  seek scene interpretation explains image data.  example, want infer projected velocities (scene)  explain consecutive image frames (image).  synthetic data, model relationship image scene  patches, scene patch neighboring scene patches.  Given' image, propagate likelihoods Markov network  (ignoring effect loops) infer underlying scene.  yields efficient method form low-level scene interpretations.  demonstrate technique motion analysis estimating  high resolution images low-resolution ones.
