 BRB: Batch Scheduling Reduce Tail Latencies Cloud Data Stores common pattern architectures modern interactive web-services large request fan-outs, single end-user request (task ) arriving application server triggers tens thousands data accesses (sub-tasks) stateful backend servers. response task bottlenecked completion slowest sub-task, making workloads highly sensitive tail latency distribution backend tier. large number decentralized application servers skewed workload patterns exacerbate challenge addressing problem. address challenges Batch (BRB). carefully scheduling requests decentralized taskaware manner, BRB enables low-latency distributed storage systems deliver predictable performance presence large request fan-outs. preliminary simulation results based production workloads show proposed design 99th percentile latency 38% ideal system model offering latency improvements state-of-the-art factor 2.
