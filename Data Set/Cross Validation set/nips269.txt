  paper describes simple efficient method template-based  object classification invariant in-plane rotations. task divided  parts: orientation discrimination classification. key idea pertbrm  orientation discrimination classification. accom-  plished hypothesizing, turn, input image belongs class  interest. image rotated maximize similarity train-  ing images class (these prototype object upright orien-  tation). process yields set images,  object upright position. resulting images classified  models trained upright examples. approach  successfully applied real-world vision-based tasks: rotated  handwritten digit recognition rotated face detection cluttered scenes.
