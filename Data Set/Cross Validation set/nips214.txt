  Cluster analysis fundamental principle exploratory data  analysis, providing user description group struc-  ture data. key problem context interpreta-  tion visualization clustering solutions high-dimensional  abstract data spaces. particular, probabilistic descriptions  group structure, essential capture inter-cluster relation-  ships, assessable simple inspection probabilistic  assignment variables. present approach visual-  ization group structure. based statistical model  object assignments observed estimated  probabilistic clustering procedure. objects data points  embedded low dimensional Euclidean space approximating  observed data statistics Gaussian mixture model.  algorithm approach visualization inher-  ent structure broad variety data types, e.g. histogram data,  proximity data co-occurrence data. demonstrate power  approach, histograms textured images visualized  large-scale data mining application.
