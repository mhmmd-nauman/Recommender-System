 End System Caching Cooperation Replace In-Network Caching CCN? CCN witnessed promising future Internet architecture. In-network caching paid attention, consensus usage, due non-negligible costs. Meanwhile, massive storage bandwidth resources end systems remain underutilized. end, present End System Caching Cooperation scheme CCN, called ESCC realize content distribution CCN, costly innetwork caching. ESCC enables fast content distribution clients caching sharing contents other. Experiments show ESCC achieve performance universal caching. simple, efficient, robust low overhead. ESCC candidate substitute costly unnecessary universal caching.
