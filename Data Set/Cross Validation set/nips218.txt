  task text retrieval find subset collection documents relevant  user's information request, expressed set words. Classically,  documents queries represented vectors word counts. simplest  form, relevance defined dot product document query  vector-a measure number common terms. central difficulty text  retrieval presence absence word sufficient determine  relevance query. Linear dimensionality reduction proposed tech-  nique extracting underlying structure document collection.  domains (such vision) dimensionality reduction reduces computational com-  plexity. text retrieval improve retrieval performance.  propose alternative technique produces sparse represen-  tations constructed sets highly-related words. Documents queries  represented distance sets, relevance measured  number common clusters. technique significantly improves retrieval per-  formance, efficient compute shares properties optimal linear  projection operator independent components documents.
