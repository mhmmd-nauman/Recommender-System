 Short vs. Flows: Battle Win paper, introduce MMPTCP, transport protocol aims unifying data transported data centres. MMPTCP runs phases; initially, randomly scatters packets network single congestion window exploiting paths. beneficial latency-sensitive flows. phase, MMPTCP runs Multi-Path TCP (MPTCP) mode, shown efficient flows. Initial evaluation shows approach significantly improves short flow completion times providing high throughput flows high network utilisation.
