 Coarse-grained Scheduling Software-Defined Networking Switches Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables consolidation control plane set network equipments fine-grained control traffic flows inside network. work, demonstrate coarse-grained scheduling mechanisms easily offered SDN switches requiring unsupported operation OpenFlow. leverage feedback loop - flow statistics - exposed SDN switches controller, combined priority queuing mechanisms, typical switches output ports. illustrate approach experimentations OpenvSwitch SDN switch controlled Beacon controller.
