  present unsupervised classification algorithm based  ICA mixture model. ICA mixture model assumes  observed data categorized mutually exclusive  data classes components class generated  linear mixture independent sources. algorithm finds  independent sources, mixing matrix class  computes class membership probability data point.  approach extends Gaussian mixture model  classes non-Gaussian structure. demonstrate  method learn efficient codes represent images natural  scenes text. learned classes basis functions yield  approximation underlying distributions data,  provide greater coding efficiency. believe method  suited modeling structure high-dimensional data  potential applications.
