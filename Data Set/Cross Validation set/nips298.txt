  article, propose reinforcement learning (RL)  method based actor-critic architecture. actor  critic approximated Normalized Gaussian Networks  (NGnet), networks local linear regression units.  NGnet trained on-line EM algorithm proposed pre-  vious paper. apply RL method task swinging-up  stabilizing single pendulum task balancing dou-  ble pendulum upright position. experimental results  show RL method applied optimal control prob-  lems continuous state/action spaces method  achieves control small number trial-and-errors.
