  present analog VLSI cellular architecture implementing simpli-  -fled version Boundary Contour System (BCS) real-time image  processing. Inspired neuromorphic models layers  visual cortex, design integrates pixel functions sim-  ple cells, complex cells, hyper-complex cells, bipole cells,  orientations interconnected hexagonal grid. Analog current-mode  CMOS circuits perform edge detection, local inhi-  bition, directionally selective long-range diffusive kernels, renormal-  izing global gain control. Experimental results fabricated 12 10  pixel prototype 1.2/zm CMOS technology demonstrate robustness  architecture selecting image contours cluttered noisy  background.
