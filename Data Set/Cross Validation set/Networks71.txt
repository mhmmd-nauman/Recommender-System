 BitMiner: Bits Mining Internet Traffic Classification Traditionally, signatures traffic classification constructed byte-level. However, data-transfer formats network protocols applications encoded bit-level, byte-level signatures losing effectiveness traffic classification. poster, creatively construct bit-level signatures associating bit-values bit-positions traffic flow. Furthermore, present BitMiner, automated traffic mining tool mine application signatures fine-grained bit-level granularity. preliminary test popular peer-to-peer (P2P) applications, e.g. Skype, Google Hangouts, PPTV, eMule, Xunlei QQDownload, reveals byte-level signatures, significant bit-level signatures hidden traffic.
