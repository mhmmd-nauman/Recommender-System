 ReWiFlow: Restricted Wildcard OpenFlow Rules ability manage individual flows major benefit Software-Defined Networking. overheads fine-grained control, e.g. initial flow setup delay, overcome benefits, time-sensitive short flows. Coarse-grained control groups flows, hand, complex: packet match multiple rules, requires conflict resolution. paper, present ReWiFlow, restricted class OpenFlow wildcard rules (the fundamental control groups flows OpenFlow), managing groups flows flexibility loss performance. demonstrate ReWiFlow implement applications dynamic proactive routing. present generalization ReWiFlow, called MultiReWiFlow, show efficiently represent access control rules collected Stanford’s backbone network.
