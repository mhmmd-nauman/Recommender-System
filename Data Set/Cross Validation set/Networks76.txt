 Supercharge me: Boost Router Convergence SDN enabling logically-centralized direct control forwarding behavior network, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) holds promise terms improving network management, performance, costs. Realizing vision challenging SDN proposals date require substantial expensive existing network architecture benefits realized. result, number SDN deployments limited scope. kickstart wide-scale SDN deployment, need low-risk, high return solutions solve timely problem. solution, show significantly improve performance legacy IP routers, i.e. "supercharge" them, combining SDN-enabled devices. abstract, supercharge aspect router performance: convergence link node failure.
