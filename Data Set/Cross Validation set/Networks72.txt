 Alternative Trust Sources: Reducing DNSSEC Signature Verification Operations TLS DNSSEC development 20 years. provable security retrieving domain names public key infrastructure (PKI). Unfortunately, significant overhead involved DNSSEC: verifying certificate chains signed DNS messages involves extra computation, queries remote resolvers, additional transfers, introduces added latency DNS query path. pose question: achieve practical security verifying certificate chain different, source trust resolvers? believe can. Namely, long-lived, mutually authenticated TLS connection pairs DNS resolvers, suggest maintain near-equivalent levels security extra overhead compared non-DNSSEC enabled resolver. reputation system probabilistically verifying portion DNSSEC responses allow near-equivalent levels security reached, face compromised resolvers.
