  Principal curves defined "self consistent" smooth curves  pass "middle" d-dimensional probability distri-  bution data cloud. Recently, [ 1] offered approach  defining principal curves continuous curves length  minimize expected squared distance curve points  space randomly chosen according distribution.  definition carry theoretical analysis learning  principal curves training data. paper propose practical  construction based definition.
