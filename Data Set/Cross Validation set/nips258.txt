  present method learning complex appearance mappings,  occur images articulated objects. Traditional interpolation  networks fail case appearance necessarily smooth  function linear manifold articulated objects. define ap-  pearance mapping examples constructing set independently  smooth interpolation networks; networks cover overlapping re-  gions parameter space. set growing procedure find ex-  ample clusters well-approximated convex hull;  interpolation proceeds sets examples.  method physically valid images produced regions param-  eter space nearby examples appearances. show  results generating simulated real arm images.
