 Automated Testing Geo-Distributed Replica Selection Algorithms geo-distributed systems rely replica selection algorithms communicate closest set replicas. Unfortunately, bursty nature Internet traffic changing network conditions present problem identifying choices replicas. Suboptimal replica choices result increased response latency reduced system performance. present GeoPerf, tool tries automate testing geo-distributed replica selection algorithms. GeoPerf test Cassandra MongoDB, popular data stores, found bugs systems.
