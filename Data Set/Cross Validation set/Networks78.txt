 Challenging Entropy-based Anomaly Detection Diagnosis Cellular Networks paper challenge applicability entropy-based approaches detecting diagnosis network traffic anomalies, claim full statistics (i.e., empirical probability distributions) applied improve changedetection capabilities. support claim detecting diagnosing large-scale traffic anomalies real cellular network, caused specific OTT (Over Top) services smartphone devices. results clearly suggest anomaly detection diagnosis based entropy analysis prone errors misses typical characteristics traffic anomalies, studied scenario.
