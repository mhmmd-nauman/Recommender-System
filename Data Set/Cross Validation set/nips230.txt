  Boosting methods maximize hard classification margin  known powerful techniques exhibit overfitting low  noise cases. noisy data boosting try enforce hard  margin give weight outliers,  leads dilemma non-smooth fits overfitting.  propose algorithms allow soft margin classification  introducing regularization slack variables boosting  concept: (1) AdaBoostreg regularized versions (2) linear  (3) quadratic programming AdaBoost. Experiments show  usefulness proposed algorithms comparison soft  margin classifier: support vector machine.
