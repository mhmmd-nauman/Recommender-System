  Training Support Vector Machine (SVM) requires solution  large quadratic programming (QP) problem. paper proposes al-  gorithm training SVMs: Sequential Minimal Optimization, SMO.  SMO breaks large QP problem series smallest QP  problems analytically solvable. Thus, SMO require  numerical QP library. SMO's computation dominated eval-  uation kernel, kernel optimizations substantially quicken  SMO. MNIST database, SMO 1.7 times fast PCG chunk-  ing; UCI Adult database linear SVMs, SMO  1500 times faster PCG chunking algorithm.
