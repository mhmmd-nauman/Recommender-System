  Computational Analysis Emotion Dynamics.  Emotions dynamic. vary continuously regard intensity, duration, persistence time, attributes. addition, appearance face subjects varies, transition facial expressions based change emotion physiological constraints. paper, examine trajectories emotions activation-evaluation space show emotion trajectories smooth follow `common' paths emotions. Statistical Modelling Complex Emotions Mixture Von Mises Distributions.  recognition basic human emotions based facial points studied extensively years. complex emotions comprised number basic emotions, order identify interpolate known basic emotions identified. paper, introduce finite mixture model recognise complex emotions represent activation-evaluation space, popular model psychology emotion representation. activation-evaluation space circular, popular probability distribution models emotion recognition inappropriate characterise complex emotions. model propose based mixture von Mises distributions, approximation normal distribution wrapped circle common model describing directional data. paper describes process estimating parameters mixture model tests fit estimated model set ground truth values emotion direction intensity. robust joint face model human emotion recognition. IVCNZ 2012: 352-357 computers recognise emotions benefits human-computer interaction, psychology, behavioural analysis. Unfortunately difficult problem, partly humans can, extent, control appearance emotion faces. paper show building statistical shape models parts face combining give successful results model face.
