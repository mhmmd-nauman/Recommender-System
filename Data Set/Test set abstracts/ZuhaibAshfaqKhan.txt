User cooperation technique exploits diversity wireless networks. paper, analyzed hybrid FDMA-TDMA access technique cooperative distributive fashion introducing implementing modified protocol introduced [1]. defined parameter termed cooperation gain parameter (CGP) function transmitter-to-receiver average received signal noise ratios. Depending CGP, decide proceed direct transmission cooperation consideration. instance, CGP (G ≪ 1), system undergo direct transmission termed Power Gain Protocol (PGP) (G ≫ 1), system operated Power Cooperation Diversity Gain Protocol (PCDGP). Vertical BLAST (Bell Laboratories Layered Space Time) V-BLAST minimum mean square error (MMSE) nulling relays perfectly detect joint signals multiple source terminals. performance analyzed binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation scheme investigated independent identical (i.i.d) Rayleigh Nakagami-m fading environments. Subsequently, simulation results show proposed scheme provide signal quality uplink users cooperative communication system hybrid FDMA-TDMA technique. ``Performance Analysis Multi-User Cooperation Diversity System MIMO Approach Fading Channels".  `A Power-Enhanced Femto Cooperative Scheme (Fe-COPE) OFDMA Heterogeneous systems Interference Mitigation 5G Networks".
