  Genetic algorithm difference expansion based reversible watermarking relational databases.  paper, present robust reversible watermarking approach protection relational databases. approach based idea difference expansion utilizes genetic algorithm (GA) improve watermark capacity reduce distortion. proposed approach reversible therefore, distortion introduced watermark insertion fully restored. GA, attributes explored meet optimal criteria selecting effective attributes watermark insertion. Checking distortion tolerance attributes selected tuple watermark capacity distortion therefore, distortion tolerance attributes explored. Distortion caused difference expansion help attacker predict watermarked attribute. Thus, incorporated tuple attribute-wise distortion fitness function GA, making tough attacker predict watermarked attribute. experimental analysis, concluded proposed technique improved capacity reduced distortion compared existing approaches. Problem false positives change attribute order detection side resolved. Additionally, proposed technique resilient wide range attacks addition, deletion, sorting, bit flipping, tuple-wise-multifaceted, attribute-wise-multifaceted, additive attacks. Authentication images 3D cameras: Reversibly embedding information intelligent approaches work, reversible watermarking approach authentication 3D cameras based computational intelligence presented. intelligent techniques based differential evolution (DE) hybrid DE employed optimize tradeoff watermark imperceptibility capacity. proposed approach suitable images 3D cameras. cameras generally concept time-of-flight produce 2D image generate depth map. approach, depth map considered secret information hidden integer wavelet transform 2D image. proposed technique prospective authenticating 3D camera images secure transmission depth map. advantage lossless recovery original 2D image needed. watermarking 2D images based integer wavelet transform threshold optimization. threshold map obtained intelligent optimization approaches watermark embedding, utilized authentication purpose correlating 2D transformed image. Experiments conducted images depth maps obtained 3D camera validate proposed concept.
