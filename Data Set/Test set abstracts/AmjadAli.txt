  VacSol: high throughput silico pipeline predict potential therapeutic targets prokaryotic pathogens subtractive reverse vaccinology. BMC Bioinformatics 18(1): 106:1-106:7 (2017) advances reverse vaccinology approaches, progressive improvement observed prediction putative vaccine candidates. Reverse vaccinology changed discovery mean propose target identification reduced labour. regard, high throughput genomic sequencing technologies supporting bioinformatics tools greatly facilitated prompt analysis pathogens, predicted candidates found effective infections diseases. pipeline, VacSol, designed based similar approach predict putative vaccine candidates rapidly efficiently.
