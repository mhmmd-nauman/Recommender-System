   Business process analysis: process warehouse-based resource preference evaluation method.   working environment, resources commonly shared tasks, multiple resources commence single task, scenario makes resource utilisation complex. Existing studies business process analysis evaluations widely focused competence resource measure performance, contended relationship resource task sufficiently understood due considering evaluations resource classes. Particularly, business intelligence-based approaches BPI adequately explored relationship. Subsequently, set relationships human resources, non-human resources tasks (named suitability, preference competence) presented. However, human resources relationship non-human resources (named preference) presented detail, resource preference model. model bundled presented preference evaluation method guides users evaluation resources preference. applicability method illustrated healthcare case study. Quality data produces evaluated empirical study, confirming claim highly relevant information generation.  ER model Star model: systematic transformation approach.   Data warehouse important component decision support systems, data interest analysis decision support purposes. data interest analysis due multidimensional nature Star model. Designing Star model requires ample amount time, experience, expertise adequate knowledge data warehouse designing steps. alternative data warehouse designing steps, transformation techniques proposed literature. techniques transform entity-relationship (ER) model (of online transaction process systems) Star model. study, present evaluate systematic approach transformation ER model Star model. prove approach, inexperienced designers produce star models identical star models produced experienced data warehouse designers. Also, prove Star model produced existing approaches Star model produced transformation approach.
