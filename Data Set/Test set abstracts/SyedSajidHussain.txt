  Job search website illiterate users Pakistan Illiteracy major hurdle socio-economic development Pakistan. Research Information Communication Technology (ICT) help tackling issue developing solutions tailored illiterate population. presented paper proposes job search website illiterate population KPK province Pakistan. designed website require human assistance searching job. Moreover, website culturally relevant graphical audio content. usability website tested according ISO-9241-11 specification. Furthermore, studied effect participants’ characteristics, i.e., age, computer mobile usage experience usability website. results show participants found website usable. Specifically, search suitable jobs minimal number clicks compared usual task completion rates reported literature. participants’ characteristics found affecting usability website. results suggest promising potential ICT solutions providing services illiterate population Pakistan. Supporting adaptation intelligibility, control, evaluation adaptation policy evolution context-based adaptive collaboration environment Facilitating understanding team-based adaptation policies Knowledge modern organizations increasingly performed collaboratively distributed teams. collaboration involves dynamically changing situations. Making collaboration environment fit needs situations supported system-initiated adaptation based user team context. Adaptation collaboration environment confuse users, remember adaptation policies. paper propose approach present context enriched explanations help understand adaptation behavior. Also, describe social network analysis strategy identify socially related current situation relevant communication partners. Integrated demand communication facilitated partners discussion understanding adaptation policies. Integrating context-enriched explanations communication adaptive collaboration environment Distributed collaboration teams involves dynamically changing situations. Making collaboration environment fit needs situations supported system-initiated adaptation based user team context. adaptations confuse users, remember adaptation policies. paper propose approach present context-enriched explanations help understand adaptation behavior. Also, describe social network analysis strategy identify socially related current situation relevant communication partners. Integrated demand communication facilitated partners discussion learning adaptation policies. Integrating end-user support negotiations requirements context-based adaptations collaboration environment Context-based adaptation reduces overhead breakdown identification handling end-users automated system-initiated adjustments behavior collaborative system. approach makes adaptation awareness, understanding revision difficult. propose process model guiding interaction end-users dealing context-based adaptations avoid problems. model empowers end-users add exceptions requirements add, modify, delete adaptation policies amendment requests. End-user negotiations conducted remove conflicts conflicting views adaptations form consensus amendment request implemented. Process support context-based adaptations collaboration environment Making collaborative environments fit needs changing collaboration situations supported collaborative tailoring customization approaches requiring end-users actively initiative tailoring customization. propose avoid overhead (1) context-based adaptations collaboration environments (2) supporting process model guiding interaction users dealing context-based adaptations. Design requirements supporting technology needed perform interactions distributed team derived process model. Pluralistic usability walkthroughs prototype implementation approach show end-users approach deal context-based adaptations assess beneficial. Local predecimation range index communication parallelization strategy fractal image compression cluster workstations.  paper, implemented evaluated performance local predecimation range index communication parallelization strategy fractal image compression beowulf cluster workstations. strategy effectively balances load workstations. evaluated execution LPRI, varying number workstations user-specified root mean square error. reported measured speedup worker idle LPRI parallelization.  comparative study parallelization strategies fractal image compression cluster workstations paper implement compare performance Message Passing Interface (MPI) static master-worker strategies MPI task farm implementations fractal image compression Beowulf cluster workstations, Local Predecimation Range Index Communication (LPRI), Global Predecimation Range Communication (GPR) Predecimation Range Index Communication (NPRI). results show MPI task farm implementations balance load effectively workers compared MPI static master-worker implementation. task farm strategies compared measuring speedup worker idle cost.
