Application homomorphism secure image sharing paper, present approach sharing images players exploiting additive multiplicative homomorphic properties well-known public key cryptosystems, i.e. RSA Paillier. Contrary traditional schemes, proposed approach employs secret sharing limits influence dealer protocol player participate help key-image. proposed approach, encryption step, player encrypts key-image dealer's public key. dealer encrypts secret-to-be-shared image public key then, encrypted key-images encrypted to-be shared image multiplied homomorphically encrypted image. step, dealer safely scrambled image corresponds addition multiplication + original images (l key-images secret image) additive homomorphic property Paillier algorithm multiplicative homomorphic property RSA algorithm. players want extract secret image, need keys dealer role. Indeed, approach, extract secret image, players need subtract key-image specific order scrambled image.
