  Baseline-Free Modal Strain Energy Method Damage Localisation study describes carried intention accomplishing ultimate objective effective damage detection structures, vibration parameters. compared vibration parameters, i.e., mode shape curvatures, damage indices, flexibility curvatures, modal strain energy method (MSEM) showed high stability damage detection. However, MSEM requires information baseline model healthy structure, compared tested structure, locate stiffness reduction. paper, baseline-free approach presented improve accuracy damage detection MSEM. Results numerical simulations experimental testing beam presented considering damage scenarios, i.e., single multiple damage damage severity small 25% large 50% thickness reduction. cases, proposed approach found generate results comparatively fewer noisy peaks damage index requiring reference baseline data.
