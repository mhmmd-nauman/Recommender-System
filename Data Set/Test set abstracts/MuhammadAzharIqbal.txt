  Reactive routing evaluation modified 802.11 realistic vehicular mobility Realistic mobility dynamics underlying PHY/MAC layer implementation affect real deployment routing protocols vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). Currently, dedicated short range communication devices wireless access vehicular environment (WAVE) mode operation, IEEE standardizing 802.11p WAVE. presents in-depth simulation-based analysis reactive routing protocols, i.e., dynamic source routing (DSR) ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) modified IEEE 802.11a PHY/MAC layers (comparable 802.11p) modified VANET mobility models (freeway, stop sign, traffic sign) terms load, throughput, delay, number hops, retransmission attempts. Results obtained OPNET simulator show urban/highway mobility scenarios, AODV’s performance forthcoming 802.11p high bit rate DSR terms high throughput, delay, retransmission attempts. Moreover, comprehensive evaluation assist address challenges future deployment routing protocols integrated devices upcoming IEEE 802.11p, concerning specific macro-/micro-mobility scenarios. annals telecommunications-annales des télécommunications  Survey network coding-aware routing protocols wireless networks recent times, advances field information theory wireless ad hoc network technologies.
