Clustering‐based power‐controlled routing mobile wireless sensor networks Framework Ubiquitous Social Networks Source Routing Proposals Multipath Inter-domain Routing Routing Proposals Multipath Interdomain Routing Internet composed numbers independent autonomous systems. BGP disseminate reachability information establishing path autonomous systems. autonomous system allowed select single route destination export selected route neighbors. selection single route imposes restrictions alternative paths interdomain link failure thus, incurred packet loss. Packet loss occurs multiple paths exist source destination paths utilized. minimize packet loss, multiple paths exist, multipath routing techniques introduced. Multipath routing techniques ensure alternative paths link failure. computes set paths primary path transit domains control traffic flow. achieved modification current BGP. paper highlights multipath routing techniques discusses overhead incurred them.
