Graphics Card Processing: Acceleration Multiple Sequence Alignment recent availability new, expensive high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies yielded dramatic increase volume sequence data analyzed. data generated purposes, including genotyping, genome resequencing, metagenomics, de novo genome assembly projects. Sequence alignment programs MUMmer proven essential analysis data, researchers need faster, high-throughput alignment tools running inexpensive hardware sequence technologies. Mapping dynamic programming algorithms graphics processing units Alignment ist die fundamentale Operation, um biologische Sequenzen zu vergleichen. Dabei geht es darum, Ähnlichkeiten zu finden, die aus strukturellen, funktionalen oder evolutionären Beziehungen entstanden sind. Heute ist die Verarbeitung von Sequenzen aus großen DNA- oder Protein-Datenbanken eine immense Herausforderung. Graphikprozessoren (Graphics Processing Unit – GPU) basieren auf einer hochparallelen Architektur von Multikernen eignen sich für die Verarbeitung von großen Datenmengen. der Arbeit wird progressives Alignment und seine parallele Implementierung durch moderne GPUs untersucht. Es zeigt sich, dass Wellenfront- und Matrixprodukt-Techniken besten mit den Datenabhängigkeiten zurecht kommen und sich gut für die Implementierung auf GPUs eignen. Die Leistung dieser Methoden wird analysiert und die Methode mit der besten Performanz wird die Alignmentstufe des wohlbekannten Softwarepakets ClustalW integriert. Ähnliche Untersuchungen  werden für das Hidden-Markov-Modell angestellt. Allgemeine Prinzipien und ein Leitfaden für die GPU-Programmierung von matrixbasierten Algorithmen werden behandelt.
