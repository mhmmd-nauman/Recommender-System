  Modal Analysis Single-Structure Multiaxis MEMS Gyroscope.  paper reports designing single-structure triaxes MEMS capacitive gyroscope capable measuring angular velocities single drive. Z-shaped beam support folded coupling spring applied suppress unwanted mode decrease stress effect spring ends. unique coupling spring changed driving motion, due slide film damping driving mode reduced. reduction lead higher performance sensor requirements vacuum level decreases cost fabrication. Simulation analysis performed COMSOL Multiphysics Matlab Simulink finalize design fabrication. finite element analysis, driving, -sensing, -sensing, -sensing are, respectively, found 13.30 KHz, 13.40 KHz, 13.47 KHz, 13.51 KHz. Semantic file annotation retrieval mobile devices.  rapid development mobile technologies facilitated users generate store files mobile devices mobile phones PDAs. However, challenging issue users efficiently effectively search files interest mobile environment involving large number mobile nodes. paper presents SemFARM framework facilitates users publish, annotate retrieve files geographically distributed mobile network enabled Bluetooth. SemFARM framework built semantic web technologies support file retrieval low-end mobile devices. generic ontology developed defines number keywords, domains properties. Based semantic reasoning, similarity degrees computed match user queries published file descriptions. SemFARM prototype implemented Java mobile platform (J2ME). performance SemFARM evaluated number aspects comparison traditional mobile file systems enhanced alternatives. Experimental results encouraging showing effectiveness SemFARM file retrieval. conclude semantic web technologies facilitated file retrieval mobile computing environments maximizing user satisfaction searching files interest.
