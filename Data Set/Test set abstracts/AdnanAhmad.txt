  Heuristic Algorithm Based Energy Management System Smart Grid. CISIS 2016: 396-402 Smart grid advanced technologies plays key role maintaining balance demand supply implementing demand response (DR). Residential users basically effect performance traditional grid due maximum requirement energy demand. Home energy management (HEM) benefit end user monitoring, managing controlling energy consumption. Appliance scheduling integral part HEM manages energy demand according supply automatically controlling appliances shifting load peak peak hours. Recently techniques based artificial intelligence (AI) meet objectives. research work, evaluate performance HEM designed basis heuristic algorithms, wind driven optimization (WDO), ganetic algorithm (GA) binary particle swarm optimisation (BPSO). Finally, simulations conducted MATLAB validate performance scheduling techniques terms cost, reduced peak average ratio (PAR) equally distributed energy consumption pattern. simulation results prove WDO algorithm based HEM proves perform efficiently BPSO GA. Realistic Home Energy Management System Exogenous Grid Signals. NBiS 2016: 458-463 promising concepts smart grid (SG) superior traditional grid demand side management (DSM). However, recent DSM techniques centralized nature primarily focus industrial consumers. contrast, paper proposes realistic home energy management system (RHEMS) incorporate residential sector DSM activities facilitate integration renewable energy sources (RESs). proposed RHEMS handle problem cost minimization optimization problem, household appliances RES scheduled response real-time pricing electricity market. First, constrained optimization problem mathematically formulated solved genetic algorithm. Simulation results show proposed scheme significantly reduce energy expenses consumer i.e. 35.53%.

Social networks access control, Choices, Control: Extending Access Control Meta-rights Reallocation.  Online Social Networks (OSN) platforms users build relationships interacting adding objects. differ simple technical systems satisfy social technical requirements, OSN access control complex subtle traditional. Currently, managed local management individual domains local roles friend. making friend rights, raising issue meta-rights, issue right. user move friend dyads groups communities, systematic scheme handle meta-rights (e.g. transferring, delegating, multiplying dividing rights) required. paper outlines general model manage meta-rights OSN socio-technical systems general. model's validity derives socio-technical design, social requirements ownership fairness give technical axioms.
