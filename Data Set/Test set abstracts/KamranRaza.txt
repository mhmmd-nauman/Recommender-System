   Topology Modular Ann Approach Multi-Modal Concept Identification Image Retrieval.  Concept identification automated image annotation helps overcome non-trivial issue image retrieval. accomplished decomposing image object level extracting concepts objects. applications biometrics, geographical information systems, automatic target recognition possess highly diffused feature vectors. Hence, conventional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) fails deliver truthful results. work, developed modified propagation algorithm proposed topology Modular Artificial Neural Network (MANN) rectify problem faced concept identification. topology trained module ANN object verse fashion highly ranked output classified output. argument supported combined application afore-mentioned algorithm topology MATLAB simulations datasets.  Improved Intrusion Detection Approach Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique Deep Belief Network.  paper presents network intrusion detection technique based Synthetic  Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) Deep BeliefNetwork (DBN) applied  class imbalance KDD-99 dataset. SMOTE eliminate class imbalance problem  intrusion classification performed DBN. proposed technique resolves  class imbalance problem KDD-99 dataset DBN estimate initial ...  Effect Feature Selection, SMOTE Sampling Class Imbalance Classification.  Accurate identification network intrusions biggest challenges Network Intrusion Detection (NID) systems. recent Machine learning classification techniques precisely identify network intrusion. However, multi class distribution network intrusion detection system found highly skewed, leading classification accuracy problem due class imbalance data set. presented paper explores role attribute selection improving classification accuracy investigates problem class imbalance Synthetic Minority Over-sampling (SMOTE) sampling major classes. classification performance evaluated types classifiers. outcome class imbalance data set under-sampling technique effective SMOTE detecting minor classes. found research decision tree algorithms (JRIP) Naïve Bayes accurate classifiers compared Radial basis neural network support vector machine. single algorithm classification multiclass proposed research combination classifier consisting Naïve Bayes JRIP classification minor classes imbalance class data set intrusion detection system.
