  Large-scale learning combinatorial transcriptional dynamics gene expression.  Knowledge activation patterns transcription factors (TFs)  fundamental elucidate dynamics gene regulation response environmental  conditions. Direct experimental measurement TFs' activities is, however, challenging,  resulting need develop statistical tools infer TF activities mRNA expression  levels target genes. Current models, however, neglect important features  TFInfer: tool probabilistic inference transcription factor activities. TFInfer open access, standalone tool genome-wide inference transcription factor activities gene expression data. Based earlier MATLAB version, software extended number ways. significantly optimised terms performance, functionality, allowing user model series data multiple independent conditions. full documentation intuitive graphical user interface, in-built data base yeast Escherichia coli transcription factors, software require mathematical computational expertise effectively.
