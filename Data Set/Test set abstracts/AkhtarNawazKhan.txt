  Design based routing wavelength assignment WDM networks link-based multiplexing gain. Optical Switching Networking 15:  Design based routing (DBR) originally proposed wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) networks objective minimize total link cost subject constraints based traffic demands terms maximum acceptable end-to-end blocking probability. DBR, optimized routing computed off-line based prior information traffic demand statistics, utilized on-line routing dynamic lightpath requests. However, integer linear programming (ILP) formulation DBR allocates, link, dedicated portions link capacity utilizing source–destination (s–d) pairs considering effects statistical multiplexing. lack consideration multiplexing gain transmission links leads unnecessary limitation applicability DBR networks high traffic loads large number s–d pairs. traffic scenarios, ILP problem DBR infeasible traffic supported violating blocking probability constraint. paper, provide alternative approach DBR, referred link-based DBR (LDBR), considering multiplexing gain link. Unlike ILP formulation DBR, imposes constraints end-to-end blocking probabilities, blocking probability constraints LDBR imposed individual links end-to-end blocking probabilities estimated union bound. Compared DBR, LDBR attractive individual links carry traffic large number s–d pairs lot opportunities utilizing multiplexing gain. Simulation results demonstrate that, subject end-to-end blocking probability constraints, proposed LDBR extend applicability DBR higher traffic loads lot active s–d pairs, expected typical backbone networks.
