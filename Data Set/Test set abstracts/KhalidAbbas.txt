   "Image transmission unequal error protected multi-fold turbo codes two-user power-line binary adder channel" ,  Impulsive noise major challenges reliable transmission power lines. Interleavers provide higher protection impulsive noise dispersing information channel spreading burst errors multiple codewords. Multi-fold turbo (MFT) coding technique improves communication reliability multiple interleavers. MFT codes, data subsequence equally protected. applications data constitute information levels importance, intuitive offer important subsequence, stronger protection. modified form MFT codes capable providing unequal error protection two-user power-line binary adder channel proposed here. benchmark, test images transmitted channel. trellis-based iterative algorithm modified two-user scenario decode received signal. simulation results show gain 1.5 dB modified MFT code conventional turbo codes transmitted images. gain dB recorded protected component image protected components.
