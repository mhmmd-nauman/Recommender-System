Previous works shown partitioning based strategies based power management techniques effectively control aging effects extend lifetime cache significantly. However, benefit comes tradeoff performance reduces proportionally elapses. address problem provide single solution concurrently improve aging, energy performance cache, propose architectural solution based dynamically re-sizable cache cache partitioning approaches. strategy, cache dynamically re-sized reconfigured cache block unreliable. Coupling aging mitigation technique dynamically re-sizable cache approach average 30% lifetime improvement 0.4x degradation performance whereas, previous solutions, performance degradation goes upto 10x.  Application-specific memory partitioning joint energy lifetime optimization.   Power management caches based turning idle cache lines low-energy beneficial aging effects caused Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI), provided idleness correctly exploited; unlike energy, aging, measure delay, fact worst-case metric. propose application-specific partitioned cache architecture cache organized set independently addressable sub-blocks; properly idleness banks drive partition determined, extend effective lifetime cache saving extra energy. distinctive features approach: First, allow cache sub-blocks age rates, achieving sort graceful degradation performance extending lifetime limits previously published works. Proper architectural arrangements introduced order cope issue progressively smaller cache. Second, sub-blocks non-uniform sizes, maximally exploit idleness joint energy aging optimization. Simulation results show extend effective lifetime cache 2x respect previous methods, concurrently improving energy consumption 50%.  Energy-optimal caches guaranteed lifetime. ISLPED 2012:   addresses aging memory sub-system due NBTI (Negative Bias Temperature Instability) systems provide guaranteed level service, specifically, guaranteed lifetime. approach leverages cache architecture smart joint redundancy power management obtain caches meet desired lifetime target minimal energy consumption. exploiting possibility putting cache sub-block redundancy deep low-power state, allowing energy saving regular architecture. Sacrificing portion cache aging mitigation marginally affects performance thanks non-linear dependency miss rate versus cache size, find cache size maximizes objective. Simulation results show meet target lifetime achieving energy reductions (measured lifetime system) ranging 3X 10X (2X 8X) lifetime target 15 (25) years, marginal miss rate overhead.
