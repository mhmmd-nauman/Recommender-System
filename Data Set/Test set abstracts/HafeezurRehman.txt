   Structure based Approach Accurate Prediction Protein Interactions Networks. BIOINFORMATICS 2016: 237-244  recent days, extraordinary revolution genome sequencing technologies produced overwhelming amount genes code proteins, resulting deluge proteomics data. proteins involved biological activity, due rapid uncovering biological “facts”, field System Biology stands doorstep considerable theoretical practical advancements. Precise understanding proteins, specially functional associations interactions inevitable explicate complex biological processes occur molecular level, understand processes controlled modified disease states. paper, present protein structure based method precisely predict interactions putative protein pairs. utilize interspecies relationship proteins i.e., sequence homology, crucial cases limited information sources biological data. enhance model account protein binding sites linking individual residues structural templates bind residues. Finally, evaluate model combining sources information Naive Bayes classification. proposed model substantial improvements terms accuracy, precision, recall compared previous approaches. report accuracy 90% tested protein interaction network yeast proteome. Boolean networks model post-transcriptional regulation gene regulatory networks. J. Comput. Science 5(3): 332-344 (2014) Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) model mechanisms regulate gene expression. computational approaches model study GNRs, Boolean network (BN) emerged successful understand structural dynamical properties GRNs. Nevertheless, widely models based BNs include post-transcriptional regulation mechanism. miRNAs proved play important regulatory role, paper show post-transcriptional regulation mechanism mediated miRNAs included enhanced BN-based model. resort miR-7 Drosophila cell fate determination networks verify effectiveness miRNAs modeling BNs, implementing tool analysis Boolean networks.  Accounting Post-Transcriptional Regulation Boolean Networks Based Regulatory Models. IWBBIO 2013: 397-404  Boolean Networks emerging simple powerful for- malism model study Gene Regulatory Networks. Nevertheless, widely Boolean Network-based models include post-transcriptional regulation mechanism. paper discuss post-transcriptional regulation mechanism mediated miRNAs included Boolean Network based model realistic representation Gene Regulatory Networks. contribution con- stitutes critical preparatory step study topological structural role miRNAs complex regulatory networks
