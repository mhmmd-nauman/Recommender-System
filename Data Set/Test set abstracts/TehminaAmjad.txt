  Finding Rising Stars Co-Author Networks Weighted Mutual Influence Finding rising stars challenging interesting task investigated recently co-author networks. Rising stars authors low research profile start career experts future. paper introduces method Weighted Mutual Influence Rank (WMIRank) finding rising stars. WMIRank exploits influence co-authors' citations, order appearance publication venues. Comprehensive experiments performed analyze performance WMIRank comparison baseline methods, weighted mutual influence. AMiner data 1995-2000 experiments. List top 30 authors proposed baseline methods compared average number papers, average number citations achievements. Experimental results provide convincing evidence effectiveness investigated weighted mutual influence.  Modelling identify influential bloggers blogosphere: survey user participatory nature social web revolutionized conventional web. social web integral part daily life. Due resulting exponential growth social web, number research domains emerged, involving research activities aim study human nature, analyse human sentiments emotions, find impact users social networks. Recently, research focus shifted identifying user's influence users social network. recent literature, find number models proposed find influential users blogging community. paper, review models find influential bloggers. existing models classified feature-based network-based categories. feature-based models consider salient factors measure bloggers' influence. network models, hand, consider graph-based social network structure bloggers identify impact fellow members. survey introduces model features, aspects, datasets used. addition discussion model, comparative analysis datasets presented. conclude discussing applications relevant literature, exploring open research issues challenges, sharing future directions active area research.  Indexing authors according domain expertise Measuring impact productivity author important, challenging task. existing methods ranking indexing authors based simple parameters publication counts, citation counts combinations. methods topic independent, ignoring intra-field differences. study introduces specific method indexing researchers measure productivity field interest, believing author interested fields level expertise fields. paper proposes Domain Specific Index (DSI), method indexing authors respect fields interest. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) applied capture latent topics text corpora. DSI calculates standing author topics interest considering topic based citations citations traditional methods. citations received multi-authored paper divided co-authors basis topic probability field. Results show giving credit received citations equally co-authors paper, weight respect level interest field, specific authors field ranked top authors.   Standing shoulders giants   survey state-of-the-art machine learning models context NLP Machine learning Statistical techniques powerful analysis tools incorporated multidisciplinary field diversely termed natural language processing (NLP) computational linguistic. linguistic knowledge ambiguous ambiguity; therefore, NLP tasks carried order resolve ambiguity speech language processing.The current prevailing techniques addressing NLP tasks supervised learning hidden Markov models (HMM), conditional random field (CRF), maximum entropy models (MaxEnt), support vector machines (SVM), Naïve Bays, deep learning (DL).The goal survey paper highlight ambiguity speech language processing, provide overview basic categories linguistic knowledge, discuss existing machine learning models classification categories finally provide comprehensive review art machine learning models goal researchers look techniques depending these, develops advance techniques. survey reviewed avantgrademachine learning models help dilemma.  Impact mutual influence ranking authors co-authorship network Online bibliographic databases providing significant resources conduct analysis academic social networks. believe author influenced co-authors. study, investigate impact productivity quality author’s co-authors ranking contribution. propose mutual influence (MI) based ranking method, ranks authors based (1) Publications author, impact publications co-authors, (2) Normalized author position based Citations weight, calculated citations received author respect position co-authors list,(3) MINCC combines impact factors. series experiments conducted results show proposed approach capability ranks authors significant way.   MuICE: Mutual Influence Citation Exclusivity Author Rank constant growth size analyzable data, ranking academic entities attention grabbing task. ranking authors, study considers author's contribution, impact mutual influence co-authors, exclusivity received citations. ranking researchers influenced ranking co-authors, co-authors seniors. Tracking citations received author important factor measure standing author. study proposes Mutual Influence Citation Exclusivity Author Rank (MuICE) algorithm. performed sequence experiments calculate MuICE Rank. First, calculated Mutual Influence (MuInf) considering factors: number papers, number citations author's appearance author. Secondly, computed MuICE incorporating factors MuInf exclusivity citations received author. Empirically, shown proposed methods generate substantial results.  Author Productivity Indexing Topic Sensitive Weighted Citations   Topic-based heterogeneous rank Topic-based ranking authors, papers journals serve vital tool identifying authorities topic domain. Existing methods measure topic-based scholarly output limited homogeneous networks. study proposes informative metric called Topic-based Heterogeneous Rank (TH Rank) measures impact scholarly entity respect topic heterogeneous scholarly network authors, papers journals. TH Rank calculates topic-dependent ranks authors considering combined impact multiple factors contribute author’s level prestige. Information retrieval serves test field articles information retrieval published 1956 2014 extracted Web Science (WoS). Initial results show TH Rank effectively identify prestigious authors, papers journals related specific topic.  Mutual Influence based Ranking Authors
