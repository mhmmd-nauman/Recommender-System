  “Automated Detection Glaucoma Structural Non Structural Features”, Submitted Springer Plus, April 2016. Glaucoma chronic disease called “silent thief sight” symptoms detected early stage permanent blindness. Glaucoma progression precedes structural retina aid ophthalmologists detect glaucoma early stage stop progression. Fundoscopy biomedical imaging techniques analyze internal structure retina. proposed technique algorithm detect glaucoma digital fundus image hybrid feature set. paper proposes combination structural (cup disc ratio) non-structural (texture intensity) features improve accuracy automated diagnosis glaucoma. proposed method introduces suspect class automated diagnosis case conflict decision structural non-structural features. evaluation proposed algorithm performed local database fundus images 100 patients. system designed refer glaucoma cases rural areas specialists motivation introducing suspect class ensure high sensitivity proposed system. average sensitivity specificity proposed system 100 87 % respectively. “Wavelet guided filter based multi-focus fusion noisy Images”, Wavelet guided filter based fusion multifocus images proposed.
