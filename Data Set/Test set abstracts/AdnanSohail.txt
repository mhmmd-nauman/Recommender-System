  Performance Evaluation Non-exhaustive Polling System Asymmetrical Finite Queues Polling systems broad range applications, e.g., modeling approaches communications, computer switching networks, service providing source shared users terminals. intention investigate performance analysis polling systems asymmetrical finite queues, simple parsimonious polling model asymmetrical finite queues presented paper. develop method solve polling system asymmetrical queues Markov chains simultaneously solve iteratively, extensions improvements previous results symmetrical queues. analyze performance parameters considered polling system, e.g., probabilities queue empty, mean number customers queue, loss probabilities customers mean flow customers system. analytical results verified simulation results. Performance Analysis Bandwidth Request Mechanism rtPS nrtPS WiMAX Uplink Traffic. recent demand high speed Internet access multimedia service increased enormously. Therefore, meet requirements WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability Microwave Access) introduced competitive alternative. IEEE 802.16 standard known WiMAX quality service provided classification scheduling types service classes. wireless medium class bandwidth requirement, maintained achieve desired level QoS (Quality Service). Extensive bandwidth allocation QoS mechanisms provided, details scheduling reservation management standard manufactures open choice implementation algorithms differentiate equipment competitors market. Therefore, paper present model processes bandwidth requests subscriber stations meet demanded QoS rtPS (real Polling Service) nrtPS (non-real Polling Service) service classes uplink traffic.
