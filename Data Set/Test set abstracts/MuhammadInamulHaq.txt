  HANDOVER ARCHITECTURES HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS MEDIA INDEPENDENT INFORMATION HANDOVER (MIH). heterogeneous networks, network selection nature multi-dimensional problem. parameters need considered handover decision making. handover accuracy efficiency, important consideration scalability signaling overhead handover algorithms. article propose break Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) based heterogeneous handover algorithm parts. execution part carried independent proactive manner prior actual handover, assuming handover architectures. handover architectures differentiated based level distribution handover algorithm multiple network components. Media Independent Handover (MIH) services retrieve share information MIH enabled nodes conformity heterogeneous network standards. proposed algorithm evaluated respect handover accuracy, handover delay efficiency signaling overhead. evaluation carried handover architectures simulations. handovers Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) networks considered. handover framework general extended consider wireless mobile communication networks. Foreground detection background subtraction histogram background subtraction method core issue is; setup threshold precisely run time, ultimately overcome bugs approach foreground detection. proposed algorithm key feature foreground detection algorithm; motion getting threshold original motion histogram possible, purpose smooth motion histogram systematic obtain threshold value. proposed algorithm main focus estimation threshold dynamic value, histogram run time. proposed algorithm intelligently terms motion magnitude motion direction distinguish accurately background foreground, camera motion camera motion object motion.
