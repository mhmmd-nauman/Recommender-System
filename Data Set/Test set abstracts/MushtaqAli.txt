   Watermark Compression Medical Image Watermarking Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) Lossless Compression Technique.   teleradiology, image contents altered due noisy communication channels hacker manipulation. Medical image data sensitive tolerate illegal change. Illegally changed image-based analysis result wrong medical decision. Digital watermarking technique authenticate images detect recover illegal teleradiology images. Watermarking medical images heavy payload watermarks image perceptual degradation. image perceptual degradation directly affects medical diagnosis. maintain image perceptual diagnostic qualities standard watermarking, watermark lossless compressed. paper focuses watermarking ultrasound medical images Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless-compressed watermarks. watermark lossless compression reduces watermark payload data loss. research work, watermark combination defined region interest (ROI) image watermarking secret key. performance LZW compression technique compared conventional compression methods based compression ratio. LZW found watermark lossless compression ultrasound medical images watermarking. Tabulated results show watermark bits reduction, image watermarking effective tamper detection lossless recovery.  Secured Telemedicine Image Watermark Tamper Localization Recovery Capabilities. Region interest (ROI) informative part medical image major part watermark. shapes ROIs selection reported region-based watermarking techniques. region-based watermarking schemes image region non-interest (RONI) important part image watermark encapsulation. online healthcare systems ROI wrong selection missing important portions image part ROI create problem destination. paper discusses complete medical image availability original destination image watermark authentication, tamper localization lossless recovery (WITALLOR). WITALLOR watermarking scheme ensures complete image security ROI selection source point compared region-based watermarking techniques. complete image compressed Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless compression technique watermark reduced number bits. Bits reduction occurs number completely encapsulated image. watermark randomly encapsulated significant bits (LSBs) image caring ROI RONI image perceptual degradation negligible. communication, watermark retrieved, decompressed authentication image, tamper detection, localization lossless recovery. WITALLOR scheme capable number tampers detection recovery part image. complete authentic image opportunity conduct image based analysis medical problem restriction fixed ROI.    Architecture Hybrid Mobile Social Networks Efficient Content Delivery.   Content delivery important technologies Mobile Social Networks (MSNs). Smart devices enable mobile users create rich set services resources surrounding environment opportunistically. paper presents framework distributed buffer storage aided hybrid Mobile Social Networks (MSN). Based this, propose scheme distributed storage efficient end-to-end content delivery intermittently connected MSNs. proposed hybrid architecture able offer fast reliable delivery services distributing buffer storage located close mobile users opportunistic MSN. Simulation experiments conducted evaluate performance proposed method, helpful improve network performance terms content delivery ratio, throughput end-to-end delays.
