  Effect thesaurus size schema matching quality.  Thesaurus Information Retrieval (IR) applications data integration, data warehousing, semantic query processing schema matching. Schema matching mapping important basic steps data integration. process identifying semantic correspondence equivalent schemas. Considering fact existence thesauri identical knowledge domain, quality change results schema matching thesauri specific knowledge field predictable. research, studied effect thesaurus size schema matching quality conducting experiments thesauri. addition, method calculating similarity vectors extracted thesaurus database proposed. method based ratio individual shared elements elements compound set vectors. Moreover, explained details efficient algorithm searching thesaurus database. describing experiments, results show enhancement average similarity presented. completeness, effectiveness, harmonic mean measures calculated quantify quality matching. Experiments thesauri show positive results average Precision 35% average Recall. effect thesaurus size quality matching statically insignificant; however, factors affecting output exact change focus future study. Rubrics Assess Usability Embedded Systems.  Cataloguing Physicality Values Physical Quantitative Evaluation Method.  Physical interfaces suffer interaction complexities leading usage difficulty poor acceptance end-users.
