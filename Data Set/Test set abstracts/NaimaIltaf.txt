   “A Mechanism Detecting Dishonest Recommendation Indirect Trust Computation ”,   Indirect trust computation based recommendations form important component trust-based access control models pervasive environment. provide service provider confidence interact unknown service requesters. However, recommendation-based indirect trust computation vulnerable types attacks. paper proposes defense mechanism filtering dishonest recommendations based measure dissimilarity function subsets. subset recommendations highest measure dissimilarity considered set dishonest recommendations. analyze effectiveness proposed approach, simulated inherent attack scenarios recommendation models (bad mouthing, ballot stuffing, random opinion attack). simulation results show proposed approach effectively filter dishonest recommendations based majority rule. comparison exiting schemes proposed approach given. “An Effective Model Indirect Trust Computation Pervasive Computing Environment”,   performance indirect trust computation models (based recommendations) easily compromised due subjective social-based prejudice provided recommendations. Eradicating influence recommendation remains important challenging issue indirect trust computation models. effective model indirect trust computation proposed capable identifying dishonest recommendations. Dishonest recommendations identified deviation based detecting technique. concept measuring credibility recommendation (rather credibility recommender) fuzzy inference engine proposed determine influence honest recommendation. proposed model compared existing evolutionary recommendation models field, shown model accurate measuring trustworthiness unknown entity.  “Modelling Interaction Trust Recommendation Ubiquitous Computing Environment”  secure computing pervasive environment, adaptive trust recommendation based access control model (based human notion trust) proposed. proposed model support calculate direct indirect trust based recommendations. handles situations (by itself) requesting entity past experience service stranger entity requesting access service past interaction service. encompasses ability reason human cognitive behavior capability adjust accordance behavioral pattern changes. X-bar control chart handle malicious recommendation. defense mechanisms incorporated proposed model attacks bad mouthing attack, oscillating behavior attack conflicting behavior attack demonstrated. “A Recommendation Exchange Protocol Smart Devices Pervasive Computing Environment”. framework exchange structured recommendation information (Trust-AML) smart devices pervasive environment (Trust-AML) proposed. specification Trust-AML inspired design principles standard-izations XML design guideline. XML-over-UDP based recommendation exchange protocol proposed share recommendation information smart devices. Implementation proposed model android smart phone open services gateway initiative (OSGI) presented demonstrate effectiveness protocol pervasive computing environment. “A Fuzzy Based Credibility Evaluation Recommended Trust Pervasive Computing Environment”, performance indirect trust computation models (based recommendations) easily compromised due subjective social-based prejudice provided recommendations. Eradicating influence recommendation remains important challenging issue indirect trust computation models. fuzzy logic based technique proposed indirect trust computation measures credibility recommendation (rather credibility recommender)to determine influence honest recommendation.  “An Attack Resistant Method Detecting Dishonest Recommendations Pervasive Computing Environment”,   attack resistant method indirect trust computation (based recommendation) pervasive computing environment proposed. method extends mechanism detect outliers dataset presented [19] apply filter malicious recommendations indirect trust computation. method based dissimilarity metric based statistical distribution recommendations grouped recommendation classes. proposed model evaluated attack scenarios (bad mouthing, ballot stuffing random attack). model compared existing evolutionary recommendation models field, shown proposed approach effectively filter dishonest recommendations provided number dishonest recommendations number honest recommendations.  “An Adaptive Framework Trust based Security Pervasive Computing Environment”,    adaptive trust based security architecture (based human notion trust) mechanism secure computing pervasive environment proposed. model encompasses ability reason human cognitive behavior capability adjust accordance behavioral pattern changes. capability lacking existing models rely mathematical calculation. strategic attack-based analysis evaluation proposed model. Finally compared model existing evolutionary models field.
