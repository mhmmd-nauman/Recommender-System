   Implementation Evaluation AREA-MAC Protocol DES-Testbed Platform. Wireless Personal Communications   AREA-MAC protocol developed efficiently deal with, others, energy delay issues Wireless Sensor Networks. MAC protocol channel polling scheme access channel. However, improves default channel polling scheme replacing preamble short preambles accompanied schemes. short preamble additional information helps sensor nodes significantly minimize energy consumption, packet delay packet losses need synchronization nodes. protocol implemented evaluated simulation testbed platforms. paper presents implementation AREA-MAC protocol DES-testbed platform evaluation results terms energy efficiency, packet delay packet delivery ratio depict design goals protocol successfully accomplished.  Secure Coverage Tree Construction Scheme Wireless Sensor Networks. Wireless Personal Communications   wireless sensor networks, nodes construct tree structure monitored area enable data aggregation transmit aggregated data multi-hopping neighbors remote sink (BS) results significant energy savings. Further- more, captured sensor node generate fictitious data misguide Sink (BS). Hence, secure communication nodes generally vital importance. Secret shared keys needed established sensor nodes secure communication them. present algorithm introduced construct tree sensor nodes wireless sensor networks. algorithm implements sleep/wake scheduling technique redundant nodes inactive maintaining initial sensing coverage active nodes. Redundant nodes replace failure nodes network tasks enhances network lifetime efficient utilization. objective research jointly design scheme sensor scheduling, tree construction active nodes, secret pair-wise keys establishment parent children network lifetime maximized. Thereafter, sensor nodes communicate securely secret pair-wise keys.
