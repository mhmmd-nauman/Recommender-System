   Synchronization nonlinear master-slave systems input delay slope-restricted input nonlinearity.  article addresses synchronization nonlinear master–slave systems input time-delay slope-restricted input nonlinearity. input nonlinearity transformed linear time-varying parameters belonging known range. linear parameter varying (LPV) approach, applying information delay range, triple-integral-based Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional utilizing bounds nonlinear dynamics nonlinear systems, nonlinear matrix inequalities designing simple delay-range-dependent feedback control synchronization drive response systems derived. proposed controller synthesis condition transformed equivalent simple criterion solved recursive linear matrix inequality based approach application cone complementary linearization algorithm. contrast conventional adaptive approaches, proposed approach simple design implementation capable synchronize nonlinear oscillators input delays addition slope-restricted nonlinearity. Further, time-delays treated advanced delay-range-dependent approach, adequate synchronize nonlinear systems higher lower delays. Furthermore, resultant approach applicable input nonlinearity, adaptation law, owing utilization LPV approach. numerical worked out, demonstrating effectiveness proposed methodology synchronization chaotic gyro systems. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity 21: 220–233, 2016  Effects Post-Adoption Beliefs Online Product Recommendation continuance:  continuance model extensively applied past studies investigating continued information system (IS) usage behavior. current study attempts extend post-adoption beliefs continuance model based effort-accuracy model, extending application continuance model instrumental focus. extended continuance model, incorporating post-adoption beliefs perceived usefulness, perceived decision quality, perceived decision effort, empirically validated data collected online survey 626 existing users online product recommendations (OPRs). data analysis revealed extended continuance explanatory power (R2 = 62.1% continued OPRs intention, = 53% satisfaction, R2 = 50.5% perceived usefulness, R2 = 9% perceived decision effort, 2= 72.3% perceived decision quality), major paths supported two. analysed data original continuance model. higher variances explained extended continuance model (D6% continued OPRs intention, D5.1% customer satisfaction, D3.2% perceived usefulness). Hence, extended continuance model provide additional information relevant understanding continued use. significant effects post-adoption perceived decision quality signify nature important boundary condition understanding continued usage behavior. practical level, extended continuance model presents product/service providers deeper insights address users’ satisfaction continued patronage   Message transmission GH-public key cryptosystem.  paper propose ElGamal type encryption scheme based concepts public key cryptosystem cubic finite field extension proposed Gong Harn (GH). proposed encryption scheme ephemeral-static, situations email recipient online. security proposed encryption scheme depends difficulty solving 3-LFSR-DLP, 3-LFSR-DHP 3-LFSR-DDHP. secure message transmission property semantic security. adapt efficient double exponentiation algorithm GH construction helps propose GH-Nyberg–Rueppel-type digital signature algorithm (GH-NR-DSA) message recovery based proposed scheme. Moreover, give countermeasures GH-NR-DSA resist known forgery attacks, namely, congruence equation attack homomorphism attack.    overview trace based public key cryptography finite fields.   Discrete Log Problem (DLP), computing [Math Processing Error]x, [Math Processing Error]y=αx [Math Processing Error]〈α〉=G⊂Fq∗, based Public Key Cryptosystem (PKC) studied late 1970’s. development PKC trapdoor function [Math Processing Error]f:Zℓ→G=〈α〉⊂Fq∗, [Math Processing Error]f(m)=αm group homomorphism. Due fact have; Diffie Hellman (DH) type key exchange, ElGamal type message encryption, Nyberg–Rueppel type digital signature protocols. cryptosystems based trapdoor [Math Processing Error]f(m)=αm understood complete.
