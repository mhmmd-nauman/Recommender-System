  Subject-independent human activity recognition Smartphone accelerometer cloud support.  Human activity recognition important task providing contextual user information. study, present methodology achieve human activity recognition Smartphone accelerometer independent subject compared user-dependent solutions. proposed system composed components; data collector, data storage cloud, workstation module activity recogniser. data collector extracts unique set defined features raw data sends data storage cloud. workstation module receives training data cloud generates classification models. activity recogniser determines user's current activity based up-to-date classifier cloud. prototype implemented android platform recognise set basic daily living activities placing Smartphone positions user evaluated offline online testing show scalability effectiveness. comparing DTW WFM techniques 3D gesture recognition.  paper compares Dynamic Warping (DTW) Waveform Matching (WFM), gesture recognition techniques, applied specific Squash game application developed. application accelerometer readings moving Nintendoâ„¢ Wiimote 3D space. application manipulates Wiimote gestures form signals. signals effect movements, positioning orientations Squash racket (actually Wiimote) computer screen. implemented Squash shots (i. e., 3D uni-stroke gestures) order compare DTW WFM. results significant difference detection gestures techniques (DTW WFM) exists strong degree association techniques. Dynamic Approach Recognize Activities WSN.  essence context awareness changed revolution ubiquitous computing, wireless sensor network technologies paved applications. Activity recognition key component identifying context user providing services based application. study, propose context management model based activity recognition. model composed components: set sensors, set activities, backend server machine learning algorithms, GUI application interaction user. prototype developed show usability proposed model. pilot testing, accelerometer data Android phone identify activities daily living (ADLs): sitting, standing, walking, jogging. accuracy results 96% average achieved activities.

Semantic Search Retrieval System Learning Objects.  paper, propose framework semantic search retrieval Learning Objects (LOs) e-Learning environments open source software. architectural design underlying model consists components designated Author Interface, Learning Object Repository, Learner Interface, Query Processing. Author Interface designed provide facility creation, addition deletion Learning Objects. Learning Object Repository stores actual objects exist formats. Query Processing module processes inputs related information retrieval keywords phrases Boolean conjunctions. module parses input search ontology tree discover semantic matches. proposed framework tested number Learning Objects domain Computer Science. test data based multimedia electronic courseware developed research team Computer Science Department, Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU), Pakistan. test results show Query Processing module accurate relevant results compared retrieval scheme based simple keywords helps instructors students benefit e-Learning environment. Efficient Live Stream Community Management Scheme Mobile.  supplied mobile terminals, increased computing power individual. Based increased utilization mobile terminals, services emerging. Also, user created content (UCC) widely available, era easily sharing contents started. Also, users prefer real-time UCC broadcasting desire communicate users user-created contents. Thus, study present mobile terminal additional servers maintenance configuring real-time personal broadcasting service. proposed scheme presents stable real-time personal broadcasting community mobile terminals. Therefore, help share contents share similar interests. allow users acquire information develop interests.
