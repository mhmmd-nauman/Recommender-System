Abstract Delay Tolerant Networks (DTN) deployed establish communications  challenging environments frequent disruptions delays due intermittently  connecting nodes, sparsely distributed wireless sensor networks mobile ad hoc  EvacSys: Cloud-Based Service Emergency Evacuation.  Natural man-made disasters wreak havoc, they're floods, earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, wild fires.  major challenges emergency situations guide safe routes disaster site basis information.  this, data multiple sources-such roadside sensory units, emergency vehicles,  satellite imagery-must processed real compute routes. However, process huge volumes sensory data real requires higher computational resources.  years, cloud computing established reliable solution meet higher data computational demands.  article, authors discuss architecture EvacSys, scalable cloud-based emergency evacuation service.  EvacSys power cloud computing process large volumes real-time sensory data gathered disaster;  computes routes evacuees, giving priority emergency vehicles.  authors present case study testing service real city transportation network.  Scalability Issues Online Social Networks.  decade witnessed tremendous increase popularity usage social network services, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.  Moreover, advances Web technologies coupled social networks enabled users access, generate, content forms.  overwhelming amount produced content resulting network traffic rise precarious scalability issues social networks,  handling large number users, infrastructure management, internal network traffic, content dissemination, data storage.  surveys conducted explore dimensions social networks, security, privacy, data acquisition.  surveys focus privacy security-related issues specifically address scalability challenges faced social networks.  survey, provide comprehensive study social networks significant characteristics categorize social network  architectures broad categories: (a) centralized, (b) decentralized, (c) hybrid.  highlight scalability issues faced social network architectures.  Finally, qualitative comparison presented architectures provided, based scalability metrics,  availability, latency, interserver communication, cost resources, energy consumption, few.  comparative study location-based recommendation systems.  Recent advancements location-based recommendation system (LBRS) availability online applications,  Twitter, Instagram, Foursquare, Path, Facebook introduced research challenges area LBRS.  content, geo-tagged media,  point location-based, trajectory-based information help connecting gap online social networking services physical world.  article, present systematic review scientific literature LBRS summarize efforts contributions proposed literature.  performed qualitative comparison existing techniques area LBRS.  present basic filtration techniques LBRS discussion services location features LBRS utilizes perform recommendations.  classification criteria recommendations evaluation metrics presented.  critically investigated techniques proposed literature LBRS extracted challenges promising research topics future work.  Opportunistic Databank: context Aware on-the-fly Data Center Mobile Networks.  recent years, significant advancement wireless communication technologies,  Bluetooth, 802.11/WiFi, ZigBee, seen mobile ad hoc networks  (MANETs). technologies enable mobile devices form on-the-fly data centers  nodes opportunistically participate data storage sharing applications [3, 8, 11].  setup, basic assumption exist taxonomy survey Green Data Center Networks.  Data centers growing exponentially (in number size) accommodate escalating user application demands.  Likewise, concerns environmental impacts, energy needs, electricity cost data centers growing.  Network infrastructure communication backbone data center plays pivotal role data center’s scalability,  performance, energy consumption, cost.  Research community endeavoring hard overcome challenges faced legacy Data Center Networks (DCNs).  efforts handle problems DCN areas.  survey presents significant insights state-of-the-art research conducted  pertaining DCN domain detailed discussion energy efficiency aspects DCNs.  authors explored: (a) DCN architectures (electrical, optical, hybrid), (b) network traffic management characterization,  (c) DCN performance monitoring, (d) network-aware resource allocation, (e) DCN experimentation techniques, (f) energy efficiency.  survey presents overview ongoing research broad domain DCNs highlights challenges faced DCN research community.  Ubiquitous Cloud-Based Context-Aware Recommendation System Mobile Social Networks.  Abstract: evolution mobile social networks availability online check-in  services, Foursquare Gowalla, initiated wave research  area venue recommendation systems. systems recommend places users closely  related preferences. venue recommendation systems studied  recent literature, existing approaches, based collaborative filtering, suffer ...  Comparative study trust reputation systems wireless sensor networks.  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) emerging technology information  extraction surrounding environment numerous small-sized sensor nodes deployed sensitive,  unattended, (sometimes) hostile territories. Traditional cryptographic approaches widely provide security WSN.  However, unattended insecure deployment,  sensor node physically captured adversary acquire underlying secret keys,  subset thereof, access critical data and/or nodes present network.  Moreover, node properly operate insufficient resources problems network link. recent years, basic ideas trust reputation applied WSNs monitor changing behaviors nodes network. trust reputation monitoring (TRM) systems proposed, integrate concepts trust networks additional security measure, surveys conducted aforementioned system. However, existing surveys lack comprehensive discussion trust application specific WSNs. survey attempts provide understanding trust reputation applications context WSNs. survey discusses components required build TRM trust computation phases explained study security attacks. study investigates recent advances TRMs includes concise comparison TRMs. Finally, discussion open issues challenges implementation trust-based systems presented.
