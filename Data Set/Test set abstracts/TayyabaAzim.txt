However, determining correct genotype–phenotype interrelationships syndromes tedious labor-intensive, especially extremely rare syndromes. Thus, computer-aided system pre-diagnosis facilitate effective efficient decision support, similar cases available, remote rural districts diagnostic knowledge syndromes readily available. paper presents non-intrusive fatigue detection system based video analysis drivers. system relies multiple visual cues characterize level alertness driver. parameters detecting fatigue are: eye closure duration measured eye information yawning analyzed mouth information. Initially, face located Viola–Jones face detection method ensure presence driver video frame. Then, mouth window extracted face region, lips searched spatial fuzzy c-means (s-FCM) clustering.
