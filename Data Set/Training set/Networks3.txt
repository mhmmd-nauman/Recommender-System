 Comparative Look Public IXP Datasets Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) core components Internet infrastructure Internet Service Providers (ISPs) meet exchange traffic. years, number size IXPs increased rapidly, driving flattening shortening Internet paths. However, understanding present status IXP ecosystem potential role shaping future Internet requires rigorous data IXPs, presence, status, participants, etc. work, cross-comparison well-known publicly IXP databases, PeeringDB, Euro-IX, PCH. key challenge address linking IXP identifiers databases maintained organizations. find AS-centric versus IXP-centric views provided databases result data collection approaches. addition, highlight differences similarities w.r.t. IXP participants, geographical coverage, co-location facilities. side-product linkage heuristics, publicly union databases, includes 40.2 % IXPs 66.3 % IXP participants commonly-used PeeringDB. publish analysis code foster reproducibility experiments shed preliminary insights accuracy union dataset.
