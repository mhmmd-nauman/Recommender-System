 show recently proposed variant Support Vector  machine (SVM) algorithm, known y-SVM, interpreted  maximal separation subsets convex hulls  data, call soft convex hulls. soft convex hulls  controlled choice parameter y. intersection  convex hulls empty, hyperplane positioned halfway  distance convex hulls, measured  normal, maximized; not, hyperplane's normal  similarly determined soft convex hulls, position  (perpendicular distance origin) adjusted minimize  error sum. proposed geometric interpretation y-SVM  leads sufficient conditions existence  choice y-SVM solution nontrivial.
