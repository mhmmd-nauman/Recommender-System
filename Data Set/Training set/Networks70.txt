 TIMELY: RTT-based Congestion Control Datacenter Datacenter transports aim deliver low latency messaging high throughput. show simple packet delay, measured round-trip times hosts, effective congestion signal need switch feedback. First, show advances NIC hardware RTT measurement microsecond accuracy, RTTs sufficient estimate switch queueing. describe TIMELY adjust transmission rates RTT gradients packet latency low delivering high bandwidth. implement design host software running NICs OS-bypass capabilities. show experiments hundreds machines Clos network topology excellent performance: turning TIMELY OS-bypass messaging fabric PFC lowers 99 percentile tail latency 9X maintaining line-rate throughput. system outperforms DCTCP running optimized kernel, reducing tail latency 13X. knowledge, TIMELY delay-based congestion control protocol datacenter, achieves results despite order magnitude fewer RTT signals (due NIC offload) earlier delay-based schemes Vegas.
