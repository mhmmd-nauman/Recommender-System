 Datix: System Scalable Network Analytics ever-increasing Internet tra?c poses challenges network operators administrators analyze large network datasets timely manner decisions regarding network routing, dimensioning, accountability security. Network datasets collected large networks Internet Service Providers (ISPs) Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) order Terabytes hour. Unfortunately, current network analysis approaches ad-hoc centralized, scalable. paper, present Datix, fully decentralized, open-source analytics system network tra?c data relies smart partitioning storage schemes support fast join algorithms e?cient execution ?ltering queries. outline architecture design Datix present evaluation Datix real traces operational IXP. Datix system deals important problem intersection data management network monitoring utilizing state-of-the-art distributed processing engines. brief, Datix manages ef?ciently answer queries minutes compared 24 hours processing executing existing Pythonbased code single node setups. Datix achieves nearly 70% speedup compared baseline query implementations popular big data analytics engines Hive Shark.
