  paradigm proposed sorting spikes multi-electrode  data ratios transfer functions cells electrodes.  assumed cell electrode stable  linear relation. dictated properties tissue,  electrodes relative geometries. main advantage  method insensitive variations shape  amplitude spike. Spike sorting carried separate  steps. First, templates describing statistics spike type  generated clustering transfer function ratios spikes  detected data spike statistics. techniques  applied data generated escape response system  cockroach.
