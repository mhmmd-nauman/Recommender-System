 Coracle: Evaluating Consensus Internet Edge Distributed consensus fundamental distributed systems achieving fault-tolerance. Paxos algorithm dominated domain, recently challenged algorithms Raft Viewstamped Replication Revisited. algorithms rely Paxos's original assumptions, unfortunately assumptions odds reality modern internet. insight current consensus algorithms significant availability issues deployed defined context datacenter. illustrate problem, developed Coracle, tool evaluating distributed consensus algorithms settings accurately represent realistic deployments. Coracle test examples network configurations contradict liveness claims Raft algorithm. process exercising algorithms realistic assumptions, demonstrate wider availability issues faced consensus algorithms deployed real networks.
