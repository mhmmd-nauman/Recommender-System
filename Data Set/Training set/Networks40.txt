 Efficient Coflow Scheduling Prior Knowledge Inter-coflow scheduling improves application-level communication performance data-parallel clusters. However, existing efficient schedulers require priori coflow information ignore cluster dynamics pipelining, task failures, speculative executions, limit applicability. Schedulers prior knowledge compromise performance avoid head-of-line blocking. paper, present Aalo strikes balance efficiently schedules coflows prior knowledge. Aalo employs Discretized Coflow-Aware Least-Attained Service (D-CLAS) separate coflows small number priority queues based cluster. performing prioritization queues scheduling coflows FIFO order queue, Aalo's non-clairvoyant scheduler reduces coflow completion times guaranteeing starvation freedom. EC2 deployments trace-driven simulations show communication stages complete 1.93x faster average 3.59x faster 95th percentile Aalo comparison per-flow mechanisms. Aalo's performance comparable solutions prior knowledge, Aalo outperforms presence cluster dynamics.
