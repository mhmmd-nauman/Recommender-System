  recent measuring image statistics  learning probability distributions images. observe  mapping images statistics many-to-one  show quantified phase space factor. phase  space approach throws light Minimax Entropy technique  learning Gibbs distributions images potentials derived  image statistics elucidates ambiguities inherent  determining potentials. addition, shows phase  factor approximated analytic distribution  approximation yields swift "Minutemax" algorithm vastly  reduces computation Minimax entropy learning.  illustration concept, Gaussian approximate  phase factor, approximation results Zhu  Mumford (1997) seconds CPU time. phase  space approach insight multi-scale potentials  found Zhu Mumford (1997) suggests forms  potentials influenced greatly phase space considerations.  Finally, prove probability distributions learned feature  space equivalent Minimax Entropy learning  multinomial approximation phase factor.
