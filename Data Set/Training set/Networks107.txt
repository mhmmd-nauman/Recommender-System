 Making Case Elliptic Curves DNSSEC Domain System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) add authenticity integrity DNS, improving security. Unfortunately, DNSSEC problems. DNSSEC adds digital signatures DNS, signi?cantly increasing size DNS responses. means DNSSEC susceptible packet fragmentation makes DNSSEC attractive vector abuse ampli?cationbased denial-of-service attacks. Additionally, key management policies complex. makes DNSSEC fragile leads operational failures. paper, argue choice RSA default cryptosystem DNSSEC major factor problems. Alternative cryptosystems, based elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA EdDSA), exist rarely DNSSEC. show highly attractive DNSSEC, disadvantages. address these, initiated research aims investigate viability deploying ECC large scale DNSSEC.
