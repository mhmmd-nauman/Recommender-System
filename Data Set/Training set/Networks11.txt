 Attacking NTP’s Authenticated Broadcast Mode identify attacks Network Protocol (NTP)’s cryptographically-authenticated broadcast mode. First, present replay attack on-path attacker indefinitely stick broadcast client specific time. Second, present denial-of-service (DoS) attack off-path attacker prevent broadcast client updating system clock; this, attacker sends client single malformed broadcast packet query interval. DoS attack applies NTP modes ‘ephemeral’ ‘preemptable’ (including manycast, pool, etc). network measurements give evidence NTP’s broadcast ephemeral/preemptable modes wild. conclude discussing NTP’s current implementation symmetric-key cryptographic authentication provide security broadcast mode, recommendations improve current affairs.
