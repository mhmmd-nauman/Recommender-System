 hyperspectral imagery pixel typically consists mixture  reflectance spectra materials, mixture  coefficients correspond abundances constituting ma-  terials. assume linear combinations reflectance spectra  additive normal sensor noise derive probabilistic MAP  framework analyzing hyperspectral data. material re-  flectance characteristics priori, face problem  unsupervised linear unmixing. incorporation  prior information (e.g. positivity normalization abun-  dances) naturally leads family interesting algorithms,  noise-free case yielding algorithm  understood constrained independent component analysis (ICA).  Simulations underline usefulness theory.
