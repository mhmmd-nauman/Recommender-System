 FALE: Fine-grained Device Free Localization Adaptively Areas Effort emerging applications ubiquitous wireless signals accelerated development Device Free localization (DFL) techniques, localize objects need carry wireless devices. traditional DFL methods main drawback pre-obtained Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements (i.e., fingerprint) area directly applied area localization, calibration process area result human effort exhausting problem. paper, propose FALE, fine-grained transferring DFL method adaptively areas human effort low energy consumption. FALE employs rigorously designed transferring function transfer fingerprint projected space, reuse areas, greatly reduce human effort. hand, FALE reduce data volume energy consumption taking advantage compressive sensing (CS) theory. Extensive real-word experimental results illustrate effectiveness FALE.
