 In-Band Synchronization Distributed SDN Control Planes Control planes forthcoming Software-De?ned Networks (SDNs) distributed : ensure availability faulttolerance, improve load-balancing, reduce overheads, modules control plane physically distributed. However, order guarantee consistency network operation, actions performed data plane di?erent controllers need synchronized, nontrivial task. paper, propose synchronization framework control planes based atomic transactions, implemented in-band, data-plane switches. argue in-band approach attractive keeps failure scope local require additional out-of-band coordination mechanisms. realize fundamental consensus primitives presence controller failures, discuss applications consistent policy composition fault-tolerant control-planes. Interestingly, part data plane con?guration space shared memory leveraging match-action paradigm, implement synchronization framework today’s standard OpenFlow protocol, report proof-ofconcept implementation.
