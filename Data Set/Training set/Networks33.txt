 Inside Social Network's (Datacenter) Network Large cloud service providers invested increasingly larger datacenters house computing infrastructure required support services. Accordingly, researchers industry practitioners alike focused deal effort designing network fabrics efficiently interconnect manage traffic datacenters performant efficient fashions. Unfortunately, datacenter operators generally reticent share actual requirements applications, making challenging evaluate practicality design. Moreover, limited large-scale workload information literature has, worse, heretofore largely provided single datacenter operator cases widespread. work, report network traffic observed Facebook's datacenters.
