 Real-time 802.11 Compatible Distributed MIMO System present demonstration real-time distributed MIMO system, DMIMO. DMIMO synchronizes transmissions distributed MIMO transmitters time, frequency phase, performs distributed multi-user beamforming independent clients. DMIMO built top Zynq hardware platform integrated FMCOMMS2 RF front end. platform implements custom 802.11n compatible MIMO PHY layer augmented lightweight distributed synchronization engine. demonstration shows received constellation points, channels, effective data throughput client.
