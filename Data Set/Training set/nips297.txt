  present method automatically constructing macro-actions  scratch primitive actions reinforcement learning process.  idea reinforce tendency perform action  action pattern actions rewarded. test  method bicycle task, car-on-the-hill task, race-track task  grid-world tasks. bicycle race-track tasks  macro-actions approximately halves learning time,  grid-world tasks learning reduced factor 5.  method car-on-the-hill task reasons discuss  conclusion.
