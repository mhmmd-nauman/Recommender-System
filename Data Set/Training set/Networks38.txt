 BwE: Flexible, Hierarchical Bandwidth Allocation WAN Distributed Computing WAN bandwidth remains constrained resource economically infeasible substantially overprovision. Hence, important allocate capacity according service priority based incremental additional allocation. example, highest priority service receive 10Gb/s bandwidth reaching allocation, incremental priority drop sharply favoring allocation services. Motivated observation individual flows fixed priority ideal basis bandwidth allocation, present design implementation Bandwidth Enforcer (BwE), global, hierarchical bandwidth allocation infrastructure. BwE supports: i) service-level bandwidth allocation prioritized bandwidth functions service represent arbitrary collection flows, ii) independent allocation delegation policies according user-defined hierarchy, accounting global view bandwidth failure conditions, iii) multi-path forwarding common trafficengineered networks, iv) central administrative point override (perhaps faulty) policy exceptional conditions. BwE delivered service-efficient bandwidth utilization simpler management production multiple years.
