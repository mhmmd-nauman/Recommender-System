 Condor: Topologies Declarative Design design space large, multipath datacenter networks large complex, design fits purposes. Network architects trade criteria design costeffective, reliable, maintainable networks, typically explore design space. present Condor, approach enabling rapid, efficient design cycle. Condor architects express requirements constraints Topology Description Language (TDL), directly network structures. Condor constraint-based synthesis rapidly generate candidate topologies, analyzed multiple criteria. show TDL supports concise descriptions topologies fat-trees, BCube, DCell; generate known variants fat-trees simple TDL file; synthesize large topologies tens seconds. show Condor supports daunting task designing multi-phase network expansions carried live networks.
