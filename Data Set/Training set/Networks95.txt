 WiMAC: Rapid Implementation Platform User Definable MAC Protocols Separation demo presents WiMAC, general-purpose wireless testbed researchers quickly prototype wide variety real-time MAC protocols wireless networks. interface link layer physical layer, MAC protocols tightly coupled underlying physical layer, need extremely small latencies. Implementing MAC requires time. fact, MACs implemented, dozens MAC protocols proposed. enable quick prototyping, employ mechanism vs. policy separation decompose functionality MAC layer PHY layer. Built separation framework, WiMAC achieves independence software hardware, offering high degree function reuse design flexibility. Hence, platform supports easy cross-layer design protocol fly. 802.11-like reference design, demonstrate deploying MAC protocol quick simple proposed platform implementation CSMA/CA CHAIN protocols.
