 IP Geolocation Crowd-sourcing Broadband Performance Tool paper, propose IP geolocation DB creation method based crowd-sourcing Internet broadband performance measurement tagged locations present IP geolocation DB based Internet broadband performance data Korea. Compared commercial IP geolocation DBs, crowd-sourcing IP geolocation DB shows increased accuracy fine-grained granularity. confirm low accuracy commercial IP geolocation DBs mainly results selecting single representative location large IP block Whois registry DB, parsing city names naive way, resolving wrong geolocation coordinates. found geographic location IP blocks continuously changed stable. IP geolocation DB limited Korea, 32 million broadband performance test records provide wide coverage finegrained accuracy.
