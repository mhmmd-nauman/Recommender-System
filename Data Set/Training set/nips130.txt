 committee approach proposed reducing model  uncertainty improving generalization performance. ad-  vantage committees depends (1) performance individ-  ual members (2) correlational structure errors  members. paper presents input grouping technique de-  signing heterogeneous committee. technique, input  variables grouped based mutual information. Sta-  tistically similar variables assigned group.  member's input set formed input variables extracted  groups. designed committees error cor-  relation members, member observes  input variable combinations. individual member's feature sets  redundant information, highly correlated vari-  ables combined together. member feature sets con-  tain complete information, set feature  information group. empirical study noisy  nonstationary economic forecasting problem shows commit-  tees constructed proposed technique outperform committees  formed existing techniques.
