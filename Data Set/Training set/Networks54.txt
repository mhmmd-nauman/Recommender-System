 ASwatch: Reputation System Expose Bulletproof Hosting ASes Bulletproof hosting Autonomous Systems (ASes)--malicious ASes fully dedicated supporting cybercrime--provide freedom resources cyber-criminal operate. services include hosting wide range illegal content, botnet C&C servers, malicious resources. Thousands ASes registered year, exclusively facilitate cybercrime. natural approach squelching bulletproof hosting ASes develop reputation system identify takedown law enforcement input attack detection systems (e.g., spam filters, botnet detection systems). Unfortunately, current reputation systems rely primarily data-plane monitoring malicious activity IP addresses (and detect malicious ASes attacks underway), able distinguish malicious legitimate abused ASes. complement systems, paper, explore fundamentally approach establishing reputation. present ASwatch, system identifies malicious ASes exclusively control-plane (i.e., routing) behavior ASes. ASwatch's design based intuition that, attempt evade detection remediation efforts, malicious ASes exhibit "agile" control plane behavior (e.g., short-lived routes, aggressive re-wiring). evaluate system known malicious ASes; results show ASwatch detects 93% malicious ASes 5% false positive rate, reasonable effectively complement existing defense systems.
