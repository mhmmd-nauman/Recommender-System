 describe Bayesian approach model selection unsupervised  learning determines feature set number  clusters. evaluate scheme (based marginal likelihood)  based cross-validated likelihood. Bayesian  scheme derive closed-form solution marginal likelihood  assuming forms likelihood function prior.  Extensive experiments compare approaches results  verified comparison ground truth. experiments  Bayesian scheme objective function gave results  cross-validation.
