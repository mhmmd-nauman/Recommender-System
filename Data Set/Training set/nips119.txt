 describe method learning overcomplete set basis  functions purpose modeling sparse structure images.  sparsity basis function coefficients modeled  mixture-of-Gaussians distribution. Gaussian captures non-  active coefficients small-variance distribution centered  zero, Gaussians capture active coefficients  large-variance distribution. show prior  form, exist efficient methods learning basis  functions parameters prior. performance  algorithm demonstrated number test cases  natural images. basis functions learned natural  images similar obtained methods,  sparse form coefficient distribution described.  Also, parameters prior adapted data,  assumption sparse structure images need  priori, learned data.
