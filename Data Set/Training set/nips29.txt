 analyze conditions synaptic learning rules based  action potential timing approximated learning rules based  firing rates. particular, consider form plasticity  synapses depress presynaptic spike postsynaptic  spike, potentiate opposite temporal ordering. differen-  tial anti-Hebbianplasticity approximated conditions  learning rule depends derivative postsynaptic  firing rate. learning rule acts stabilize persistent neural activity  patterns recurrent neural networks.
