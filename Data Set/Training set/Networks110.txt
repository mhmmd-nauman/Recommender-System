 Edge-centric Computing: Vision Challenges aspects human activity, continuous struggle forces centralization decentralization. Computing exhibits phenomenon; mainframes PCs local networks past, decade seen centralization consolidation services applications data centers clouds. position shift necessary. Technological advances powerful dedicated connection boxes deployed homes, high capacity mobile end-user devices powerful wireless networks, growing user concerns trust, privacy, autonomy requires taking control computing applications, data, services central nodes (the “core”) logical extreme (the “edge”) Internet. position development help blurring boundary machine, embrace social computing humans part computation decision making loop, resulting human-centered system design. refer vision human-centered edge-device based computing Edge-centric Computing. elaborate position paper vision present research challenges implementation.
