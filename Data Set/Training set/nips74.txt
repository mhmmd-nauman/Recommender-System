 paper, present Committee, multi-class learning algo-  rithm related Winnow family algorithms. Committee al-  gorithm combining predictions set sub-experts on-  line mistake-bounded model learning. sub-expert special type  attribute predicts distribution finite number classes.  Committee learns linear function sub-experts function  class predictions. provide bounds Committee show  performs target represented relevant  sub-experts. show Committee solve  traditional problems composed attributes. leads natural ex-  tension learns multi-class problems traditional  attributes sub-experts.
