 Unsupervised learning algorithms designed extract struc-  ture data samples. Reliable robust inference requires  guarantee extracted structures typical data source,  i.e., similar structures inferred sample  set data source. overfitting phenomenon max-  imum entropy based annealing algorithms exemplarily studied  class histogram clustering models. Bernstein's inequality  large deviations determine maximally achievable  approximation quality parameterized minimal temperature.  Monte Carlo simulations support proposed model selection cri-  terion finite temperature annealing.
