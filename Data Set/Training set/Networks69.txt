 Alibi Routing mechanisms users gain insight packets gone, mechanisms allow users undeniable proof packets traverse parts host. paper introduces problem finding "proofs avoidance": evidence paths packet response avoided user-specified set "forbidden" geographic regions. Proving happen intractable, demonstrate lowoverhead proof structure built idea call "alibis": relays timing constraints that, upheld, impossible traverse relay forbidden regions. present Alibi Routing, peer-to-peer overlay routing system finding alibis securely efficiently. primary distinguishing characteristics Alibi Routing require knowledge of--or modifications to--the Internet's routing hardware policies. Rather, Alibi Routing able derive proofs avoidance user-provided GPS coordinates speed light propagation delays. PlanetLab deployment larger-scale simulations, evaluate Alibi Routing demonstrate source-destination pairs avoid countries choosing latency inflation. identify Alibi Routing work: difficulty avoiding regions users close (or, course, inside of).
