 Interplay Link-Flooding Attacks Traffic Engineering Link-flooding attacks potential disconnect entire countries Internet. Moreover, newly proposed indirect link-flooding attacks, “Crossfire”, extremely hard expose and, subsequently, mitigate effectively. Traffic Engineering (TE) network’s natural mitigating link overload events, balancing load restoring connectivity. poses question: need kind TE expose attack well? key idea carefully crafted, attack-aware TE force attacker follow improbable traffic patterns, revealing target identity time. show existing TE modules efficiently expose attack, study benefits approach. implement defense prototypes simulation mechanisms evaluate extensively multiple real topologies.
