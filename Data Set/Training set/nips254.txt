  paper introduces method regularization HMM systems  avoids parameter overfitting caused insufficient training data. Regu-  larization augmenting EM training method penalty  term favors simple smooth HMM systems. penalty term  constructed mixture model negative exponential distributions  assumed generate dependent emission probabilities  HMMs. method successful transfer known  regularization approach neural networks HMM domain  interpreted generalization traditional state-tying HMM sys-  tems. effect regularization demonstrated continuous speech  recognition tasks improving overfitted triphone models speaker  adaptation limited training data.
