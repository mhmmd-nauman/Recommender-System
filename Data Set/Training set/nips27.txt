 Human reaction times sensory-motor tasks vary consider-  ably. begin understand variability arises, exam-  ined neuronal populational response variability early versus  late visual processing stages. conventional view pre-  cise temporal information gradually lost information passed  layered network mean-rate "units." tested hu-  mans neuronal populations processing stages  behave mean-rate "units". blind source separation algorithm  applied MEG signals sensory-motor integration tasks.  Response latency variability multiple visual sources  estimated detecting single-trial stimulus-locked events  source. subjects tested visual reaction  tasks, reliably identified sources belonging early late vi-  sual processing stages. standard deviation response latency  smaller early late processing stages. sup-  ports hypothesis human populational response vari-  ability increases early late visual processing stages.
