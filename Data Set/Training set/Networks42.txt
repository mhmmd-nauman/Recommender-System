 Multi-Context TLS (mcTLS): Enabling Secure In-Network Functionality TLS significant fraction Internet traffic encrypted HTTPS likely default HTTP/2. However, Transport Layer Security (TLS), standard protocol encryption Internet, assumes functionality resides endpoints, making impossible in-network services optimize network resource usage, improve user experience, protect clients servers security threats. Re-introducing in-network functionality TLS sessions today hacks, weakening security. paper introduce multi-context TLS (mcTLS), extends TLS support middleboxes. mcTLS breaks current "all-or-nothing" security model allowing endpoints content providers explicitly introduce middleboxes secure end-to-end sessions controlling parts data read write. evaluate prototype mcTLS implementation controlled "live" experiments, showing benefits cost minimal overhead. importantly, show mcTLS incrementally deployed requires small client, server, middlebox software.
