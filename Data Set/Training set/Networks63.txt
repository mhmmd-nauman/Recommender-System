 Scaling Clustered Network Appliances ScaleBricks paper presents ScaleBricks, design building scalable, clustered network appliances "pin" flow specific handling node able choose node be. ScaleBricks applies new, compact lookup structure route packets directly handling node, incurring cost multiple hops internal interconnect. lookup structure times smaller alternative approach fully replicating forwarding table nodes. result, ScaleBricks able improve throughput latency simultaneously increasing total number flows handled cluster. architecture effective practice: optimize packet forwarding existing commercial LTE-to-Internet gateway, increases throughput four-node cluster 23%, reduces latency 10%, saves memory, stores 5.7x entries forwarding table.
