 discuss information theoretic approach categorizing mod-  eling dynamic processes. approach learn compact informa-  tive statistic summarizes past states predict future observations.  Furthermore, uncertainty prediction characterized nonpara-  metrically joint density learned statistic present obser-  vation. discuss application technique noise driven  dynamical systems random processes sampled density  conditioned past. case show results  dynamics random walk statistics driving noise  captured. case present results summarizing  statistic learned noisy random telegraph waves differing de-  pendencies past states. cases algorithm yields principled  approach discriminating processes differing dynamics and/or de-  pendencies. method grounded ideas information theory  nonparametric statistics.
