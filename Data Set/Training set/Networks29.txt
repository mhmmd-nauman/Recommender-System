 Lessons Learned RIPE Atlas Platform Measurement Research reflect experience RIPE Atlas platform measurement-based research. show addition credits, control checks rate limits place ensure platform overloaded measurements. show Autonomous System (AS)-based distribution RIPE Atlas probes heavily skewed limits possibilities measurements sourced specific origin-AS. discuss significance probe calibration leverage identify load issues older hardware versions (38.6% Sep 2014) probes. show performance measurement platforms (such RIPE Atlas, SamKnows, BISmark Dasu) benefit demonstrating use-cases. open discussion RIPE Atlas deployment relaying probe metadata information scientific community strategically deploying probes reduce inherent sampling bias embedded probe-based measurement platforms.
