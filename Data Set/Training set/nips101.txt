 system emulating functionality moving eye  oculo-motor system--has built successfully tested.  optical device shifting field view image sensor  45 direction, neuromorphic analog VLSI circuits imple-  menting oculo-motor control loop, off-the-shelf electronics.  custom integrated circuits communicate primarily  non-arbitrated address-event buses. system implements behav-  iors saliency-based saccadic exploration, smooth pursuit light  spots. duration saccades ranges 45 ms 100 ms,  comparable human eye performance. Smooth pursuit operates light  sources moving 50 ø/s visual field.
