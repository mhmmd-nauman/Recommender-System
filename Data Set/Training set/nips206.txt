  Inference key component learning probabilistic models par-  tially observable data. learning temporal models,  inference phases requires traversal entire data se-  quence; furthermore, data structures manipulated exponentially  large, making process computationally expensive. [2], describe  approximate inference algorithm monitoring stochastic processes,  prove bounds approximation error. paper, apply  algorithm approximate forward propagation step EM algorithm  learning temporal Bayesian networks. provide related approxi-  mation backward step, prove error bounds combined  algorithm. show empirically that, real-life domain, EM  inference algorithm faster EM exact inference,  degradation quality learned model. extend  analysis online learning task, showing bound error  resulting restricting attention small window observations.  present online EM learning algorithm dynamic systems,  show learns faster standard offiine EM.
