 Recently, number authors proposed treating dialogue systems Markov  decision processes (MDPs). However, practical application MDP algorithms  dialogue systems faces number severe technical challenges. built  general software tool (RLDS, Reinforcement Learning Dialogue Systems)  based MDP framework, applied dialogue corpora gathered  dialogue systems built AT&T Labs. experiments demonstrate  RLDS holds promise tool "browsing" understanding correlations  complex, temporally dependent dialogue corpora.
