 performance regular irregular Gallager-type error-  correcting code investigated methods statistical physics.  transmitted codeword comprises products original mes-  sage bits selected randomly-constructed sparse matrices;  number non-zero row/column elements matrices  constitutes family codes. show Shannon's channel  capacity saturated equilibrium regular  codes slightly lower performance obtained  higher practical relevance. Decoding aspects con-  sidered employing TAP approach identical  commonly belief-propagation-based decoding. show  irregular codes saturate Shannon's capacity improved  dynamical properties.
