 Packet-Level Telemetry Large Datacenter Networks Debugging faults complex networks requires capturing analyzing traffic packet level. task, datacenter networks (DCNs) present unique challenges scale, traffic volume, diversity faults. troubleshoot faults timely manner, DCN administrators a) identify affected packets inside large volume traffic; b) track multiple network components; c) analyze traffic traces fault patterns; d) test confirm potential causes. knowledge, tool today achieve specificity scale required task. present Everflow, packet-level network telemetry system large DCNs. Everflow traces specific packets implementing powerful packet filter top "match mirror" functionality commodity switches. shuffles captured packets multiple analysis servers load balancers built switch ASICs, sends "guided probes" test confirm potential faults. present experiments demonstrate Everflow's scalability, share experiences troubleshooting network faults gathered running months Microsoft's DCNs.
