 Caraoke: E-Toll Transponder Network Smart Cities Electronic toll collection transponders, e.g., E-ZPass, widely-used wireless technology. 70% 89% cars devices, states plan mandatory. wireless devices however, lack basic function: MAC protocol prevents collisions. Hence, today, queried directional antennas isolated spots. However, interact e-toll transponders city despite collisions, enable smart applications. example, city query transponders estimate vehicle flow intersection. localize cars wireless signals, detect run redlight. infrastructure deliver smart streetparking, user parks street, city localizes car, automatically charges account. paper presents Caraoke, networked system delivering smart services e-toll transponders. design operates existing unmodified transponders, allowing applications communicate with, localize, count transponders, despite wireless collisions. so, Caraoke exploits structure transponders' signal properties frequency domain. built Caraoke reader small PCB harvests solar energy easily deployed street lamps. evaluated Caraoke streets campus demonstrated capabilities.
