 Poptrie: Compressed Trie Population Count Fast Scalable Software IP Routing Table Lookup Internet Things leads routing table explosion. inexpensive approach IP routing table lookup required growing size Internet. contribute fast scalable software routing lookup algorithm based multiway trie, called Poptrie. Named approach traversing tree, leverages population count instruction bit-vector indices descendant nodes compress data structure CPU cache. Poptrie outperforms state-of-the-art technologies, Tree BitMap, DXR SAIL, evaluations random real destination queries 35 routing tables, including real global tier-1 ISP's full-route routing table. Poptrie peaks 174 240 Million lookups (Mlps) single core tables 500- 800k routes, consistently 4-578% faster competing algorithms tests ran. provide comprehensive performance evaluation, remarkably CPU cycle analysis. paper shows suitability Poptrie future Internet including IPv6, larger route table expected longer prefixes.
