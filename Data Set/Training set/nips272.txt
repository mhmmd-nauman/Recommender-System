  High Energy Physics experiments sort high  flux events, rate tens MHz, select  interest. key factors making decision  location vertex interaction, led event,  took place. present solution problem  finding location vertex, based feedforward neu-  ral networks fixed architectures, parameters chosen  obtain high accuracy. system tested simu-  lated data sets, shown perform conventional  algorithms.
