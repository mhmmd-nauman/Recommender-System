  common represent series divide short-  duration blocks, represented set basis  functions. limitation approach, however, tem-  poral alignment basis functions underlying structure  series arbitrary. present algorithm encoding  series require blocking data. algorithm  finds efficient representation inferring temporal po-  sitions functions kernel basis. arbitrary  temporal extent constrained orthogonal.  model capture structure signal occur  arbitrary temporal positions preserves relative temporal  structure underlying events. model shown equivalent  sparse highly overcomplete basis. model,  mapping data representation nonlinear,  computed efficiently. form ex-  isting methods adapting basis data. approach  applied speech data results shift invariant, spike-like  representation resembles coding cochlear nerve.
