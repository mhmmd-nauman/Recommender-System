 Paxos Switch-y Paxos protocol foundation building fault-tolerant distributed systems services. paper posits significant performance benefits gained implementing Paxos logic network devices. recently, notion switchbased implementation Paxos daydream. However, flexible hardware horizon provide customizable packet processing pipelines needed implement Paxos. hardware readily available, vendors consortia programming languages target devices public. paper describes implementation Paxos languages, P4. Implementing Paxos critical case P4, help drive requirements data plane languages general. term, imagine consensus someday offered network service, point-to-point communication provided today.
