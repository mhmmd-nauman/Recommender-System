 Multi-Domain Service Orchestration Networks Clouds: Unified Approach End-to-end service delivery includes transparently inserted Network Functions (NFs) path. Flexible service chaining require dynamic instantiation NFs traffic forwarding overlays. Virtualization techniques compute networking, cloud Software Defined Networking (SDN), promise flexibility service providers. However, patching existing cloud network control mechanisms necessarily puts above, e.g., OpenDaylight OpenStack controller. designed implemented joint cloud network resource virtualization programming API. demonstration, show abstraction capable flexible service chaining control technology domains.
