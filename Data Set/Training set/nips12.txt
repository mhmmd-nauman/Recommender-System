 Attractor networks, map input space discrete out-  put space, pattern completion. However, designing  net set attractors notoriously tricky; training  procedures CPU intensive produce spurious attrac-  tors ill-conditioned attractor basins. difficulties occur  connection network participates encod-  ing multiple attractors. describe alternative formulation  attractor networks encoding knowledge local,  distributed. localist attractor networks similar  dynamics distributed counterparts, easier  interpret. propose statistical formulation  localist attractor net dynamics, yields convergence proof  mathematical interpretation model parameters.
