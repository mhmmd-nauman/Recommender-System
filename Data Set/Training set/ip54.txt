Robust calibration of broadcast cameras based on ellipse and line contours
Professional TV studio footage often poses specific challenges to camera calibration due to lack of features and complex camera operation. As available algorithms often fail, we propose a novel approach based on robust tracking of ellipse and line features of a predefined logo. We further devise a predictive and iterative estimation algorithm, which incorporates confidence measures and filtering. Our results validate accuracy and reliability of our approach, demonstrated with challenging professional footage.
