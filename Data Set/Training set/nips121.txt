 statistics photographic images, represented  multiscale (wavelet) bases, exhibit striking types non-  Gaussian behavior. First, marginal densities coefficients  extended heavy tails. Second, joint densities exhibit vari-  ance dependencies captured second-order models. ex-  amine properties class Gaussian scale mixtures, show  densities accurately characterize marginal  joint distributions natural image wavelet coefficients.  class model suggests Markov structure, wavelet coeffi-  cients linked hidden scaling variables local  image structure. derive estimator hidden variables,  show nonlinear "normalization" procedure  Gaussianize coefficients.
