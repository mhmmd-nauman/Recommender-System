  Determining relationship activity single nerve  cell entire population fundamental question  bears basic neural computation paradigms. paper  apply information theoretic approach quantify level  cooperative activity cells behavioral context.  discriminate synergetic activity cells vs.  redundant activity, depending difference infor-  mation provide measured jointly information  provide independently. define synergy pos-  itive case negative show  synergy measured detecting behavioral mode  animal simultaneously recorded activity cells.  observe cortical cells positive synergy found,  cells basal ganglia, active task,  exhibit similar synergetic activity.
