 researchers explored methods hierarchical reinforce-  ment learning (RL) temporal abstractions, abstract  actions defined perform primitive actions  terminating. However, known learning ab-  stractions, aspects space ignored. previ-  ous work, developed MAXQ method hierarchical RL.  paper, define conditions abstraction  combined MAXQ function decomposition.  prove MAXQ-Q learning algorithm converges  conditions show experimentally abstraction  important successful application MAXQ-Q learning.
