  present split merge EM (SMEM) algorithm overcome local  maximum problem parameter estimation finite mixture models.  case mixture models, non-global maxima involve  components mixture model part space an-  other, widely separated part space. escape configurations  repeatedly perform simultaneous split merge operations  criterion efficiently selecting split merge candidates. apply  proposed algorithm training Gaussian mixtures mixtures  factor analyzers synthetic real data show effectiveness  split merge operations improve likelihood  training data held-out test data.
