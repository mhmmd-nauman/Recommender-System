  present Monte-Carlo generalized EM equations learning non-  linear space models. difficulties lie Monte-Carlo E-step  consists sampling posterior distribution hidden  variables observations. idea presented paper  generate samples Gaussian approximation true posterior  easy obtain independent samples. parameters  Gaussian approximation derived extended Kalman  filter Fisher scoring algorithm. case posterior density mul-  timodal propose approximate posterior sum Gaussians  (mixture modes approach). show sampling approxi-  mate posterior densities obtained algorithms leads  models point estimates hidden states. exper-  iment, Fisher scoring algorithm obtained approximation  posterior mode EKF. multimodal distribution, mix-  ture modes approach gave superior results.
