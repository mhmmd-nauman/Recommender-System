 TCP Stretch Acknowledgements Timestamps: Findings Implications Passive RTT Measurement paper examines TCP characteristics effect existing passive RTT measurement techniques. particular, packet traces geographically distributed vantage points, find low TCP timestamps significant presence stretch acknowledgements. simply affects applicability measurement techniques, principle affect accuracy RTT estimation. insights, quantify implications common methodologies passive RTT measurement. particular, show that, unlike delayed TCP acknowledgement, stretch acknowledgements distort RTT estimations.
