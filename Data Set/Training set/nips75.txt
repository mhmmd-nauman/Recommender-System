 incorporate prior knowledge construct nonlinear algorithms  invariant feature extraction discrimination. Employing  unified framework terms nonlinear variant Rayleigh  coefficient, propose non-linear generalizations Fisher's dis-  criminant oriented PCA Support Vector kernel functions.  Extensive simulations show utility approach.
