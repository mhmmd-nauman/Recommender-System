FACE spoofing detection using LDP-TOP
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for face spoofing detection using the high-order Local Derivative Pattern from Three Orthogonal Planes (LDP-TOP). The proposed method is not only simple to derive and implement, but also highly efficient, since it takes into account both spatial and temporal information in different directions of subtle face movements. According to experimental results, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three reference datasets, namely Idiap REPLAY-ATTACK, CASIA-FASD, and MSU MFSD. Moreover, it requires only 25 video frames from each video, i.e., only one second, and thus potentially can be performed in real time even on low-cost devices.
