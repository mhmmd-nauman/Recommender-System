  paper describes Bayesian graph matching algorithm  data-mining large structural data-bases. matching al-  gorithm edge-consistency node attribute similarity de-  termine posterJori probability query graph  candidate matches data-base. node feature-vectors  constructed computing normalised histograms pairwise ge-  ometric attributes. Attribute similarity assessed computing  Bhattacharyya distance histograms. Recognition  realised selecting candidate data-base  largest posterJori probability. illustrate recognition  technique data-base 2500 line patterns extracted  real-world imagery. recognition technique shown  significantly outperform number algorithm alternatives.
