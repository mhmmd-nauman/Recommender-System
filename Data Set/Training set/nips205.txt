  Standard techniques (eg.

However, handle complex dynamics, involving  multiple classes motion. problem, show  EM combined CONDENSATION algorithm,  based propagation random sample-sets. Experiments  performed visually observed juggling, plausible dy-  namical models found emerge learning process.
