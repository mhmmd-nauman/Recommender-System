 SpotFi: Decimeter Level Localization WiFi paper presents design implementation SpotFi, accurate indoor localization system deployed commodity WiFi infrastructure. SpotFi information exposed WiFi chips require hardware firmware changes, achieves accuracy state-of-the-art localization systems. SpotFi makes key technical contributions. First, SpotFi incorporates super-resolution algorithms accurately compute angle arrival (AoA) multipath components access point (AP) antennas. Second, incorporates filtering estimation techniques identify AoA direct path localization target AP assigning values path depending likely path direct path. experiments multipath rich indoor environment show SpotFi achieves median accuracy 40 cm robust indoor hindrances obstacles multipath.
