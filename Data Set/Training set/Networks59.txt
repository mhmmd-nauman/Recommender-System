 InterTubes: Study Long-haul Fiber-optic Infrastructure complexity enormous costs installing longhaul fiber-optic infrastructure led significant amount infrastructure sharing previously installed conduits. paper, study characteristics implications infrastructure sharing analyzing long-haul fiber-optic network US. start fiber maps provided tier-1 ISPs major cable providers construct map long-haul fiber-optic infrastructure. rely previously underutilized data sources form public records federal, state, municipal agencies improve fidelity map. quantify resulting map's1 connectivity characteristics confirm clear correspondence long-haul fiber-optic, roadway, railway infrastructures. Next, examine prevalence high-risk links mapping end-to-end paths resulting large-scale traceroute campaigns fiber-optic infrastructure map. show risk latency (i.e., propagation delay) reduced deploying links previously unused transportation corridors rights-of-way. particular, focusing subset high-risk links sufficient improve robustness network failures. Finally, discuss implications findings issues related performance, net neutrality, policy decision-making.
