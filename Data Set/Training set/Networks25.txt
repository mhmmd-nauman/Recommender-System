 Cooperative Group Provisioning Latency Guarantees Multi-Cloud Deployments set datacenters groups application clients, well-connected datacenters rented traffic proxies reduce client latency. Rental costs minimized meeting application specific latency needs. Here, formally define Cooperative Group Provisioning problem show NP-hard approximate constant factor. introduce greedy approach demonstrate promise extensive simulation real cloud network topology measurements realistic client churn. ?nd multi-cloud deployments dramatically increase likelihood meeting group latency thresholds minimal cost increase compared single-cloud deployments.
