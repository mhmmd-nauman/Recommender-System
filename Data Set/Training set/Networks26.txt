 Stars: Revisiting Virtual Cluster Embeddings well-known cloud application performance critically depend network. years, systems developed provide application illusion virtual cluster : star-shaped virtual network topology connecting virtual machines logical switch absolute bandwidth guarantees. paper, debunk myths virtual cluster embedding problem. First, show virtual cluster embedding problem NP-hard, present fast optimal embedding algorithm VC-ACE arbitrary datacenter topologies. Second, argue resources wasted enforcing star-topology embeddings, alternatively promote hose embedding approach. discuss computational complexity hose embeddings derive HVC-ACE algorithm. simulations substantiate benefits hose embeddings terms acceptance ratio resource footprint.
