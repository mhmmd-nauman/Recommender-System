 Reinforcement learning nonstationary environments generally  regarded important difficult problem. paper  partially addresses problem formalizing subclass nonsta-  tionary environments. environment model, called hidden-mode  Markov decision process (HM-MDP), assumes environmental  confined small number hidden modes.  mode basically indexes Markov decision process (MDP)  evolves according Markov chain. HM-MDP  special case partially observable Markov decision processes  (POMDP), modeling HM-MDP environment gen-  eral POMDP model unnecessarily increases problem complex-  ity. variant Baum-Welch algorithm developed model  learning requiring data time.
