 Hopper: Decentralized Speculation-aware Cluster Scheduling Scale clusters continue grow size complexity, providing scalable predictable performance increasingly important challenge. crucial roadblock achieving predictable performance stragglers, i.e., tasks significantly longer expected run. point, speculative execution widely adopted mitigate impact stragglers. However, speculation mechanisms designed operated independently job scheduling when, fact, scheduling speculative copy task direct impact resources jobs. work, present Hopper, job scheduler speculationaware, i.e., integrates tradeoffs speculation job scheduling decisions. implement centralized decentralized prototypes Hopper scheduler show 50% (66%) improvements state-of-the-art centralized (decentralized) schedulers speculation strategies achieved coordination scheduling speculation.
