 Cluster based Multipath Routing Protocol Wireless Sensor Networks Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists low power sensor nodes. Energy main constraint sensor nodes. paper, propose cluster based multipath routing protocol, clustering multipath techniques reduce energy consumption increase reliability. basic idea reduce load sensor node giving responsibility base station (sink). implemented compared protocol existing protocols found energy-e?cient reliable.
