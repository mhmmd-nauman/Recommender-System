  introduce semi-supervised support vector machine (S3VM)  method. training set labeled data working set  unlabeled data, SgVM constructs support vector machine us-  ing training working sets. SgVM solve  transduction problem risk minimization (ORM)  posed Vapnik. transduction problem estimate  classification function points working  set. contrasts standard inductive learning problem  estimating classification function values  fixed function deduce classes working  set data. propose general SgVM model minimizes  misclassification error function capacity based  data. show S3VM model I-norm lin-  ear support vector machines converted mixed-integer  program solved exactly integer programming. Re-  suits SgVM standard 1-norm support vector machine  approach compared ten data sets. computational re-  sults support statistical learning theory results showing  incorporating working data improves generalization insuffi-  cient training information available. case, SgVM  improved showed significant difference generalization com-  pared traditional approach.
