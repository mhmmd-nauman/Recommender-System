 present learning architecture: Decision Directed Acyclic  Graph (DDAG), combine two-class classifiers  multiclass classifier. N-class problem, DDAG con-  tains N(N - 1)/2 classifiers, pair classes. present  VC analysis case node classifiers hyperplanes; re-  sulting bound test error depends margin achieved  nodes, dimension space. motivates  algorithm, DAGSVM, operates kernel-induced feature space  two-class maximal margin hyperplanes decision-node  DDAG.
