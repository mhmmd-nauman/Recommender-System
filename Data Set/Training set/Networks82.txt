 Cache'n DASH: Efficient Caching DASH HTTP-based video streaming services dominating global IP traffic years. Caching video content reduces load content servers. case Dynamic Adaptive Streaming HTTP (DASH), video server needs host multiple representations video file. individual representations broken smaller segments. Hence, video server needs host thousands segments which, client downloads subset segments. Also, depending network conditions, adaptation scheme client-end request set video segments (varying bitrate) video. caching DASH videos presents unique challenges. order optimize cache hits minimize misses DASH video streaming services propose Adaptation Aware Cache (AAC) framework determine segments prefetched retained cache. current scheme, bandwidth estimates cache server knowledge rate adaptation scheme client estimate segment requests, improving prefetching cache.
