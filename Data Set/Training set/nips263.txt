  Face recognition class problem, number known  individuals; support vector machines (SVMs) binary classi-  fication method. reformulating face recognition problem re-  interpreting output SVM classifier, developed SVM-based  face recognition algorithm. face recognition problem formulated  problem difference space, models dissimilarities  facial images. difference space formulate face recognition  class problem. classes are: dissimilarities faces  person, dissimilarities faces people.  modifying interpretation decision surface generated SVM,  generated similarity metric faces learned ex-  amples differences faces. SVM-based algorithm com-  pared principal component analysis (PCA) based algorithm  difficult set images FERET database. Performance mea-  sured verification identification scenarios. identification  performance SVM 77-78% versus 54% PCA. verification,  equal error rate 7% SVM 13% PCA.
