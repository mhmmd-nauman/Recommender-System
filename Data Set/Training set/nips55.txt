 present technique series analysis based dy-  namic probabilistic networks. approach, observed data  modeled terms unobserved, mutually independent factors,  recently introduced technique Independent Factor Anal-  ysis (IFA). However, unlike IFA, factors i.i.d.;  factor temporal statistical characteristics. derive  family EM algorithms learn structure underlying  factors relation data. algorithms perform  source separation noise reduction integrated manner,  demonstrate superior performance compared IFA.
