  present probabilistic method fusion images produced  multiple sensors. approach based image formation  model sensor images noisy, locally linear functions  underlying, true scene. Bayesian framework  maximum likelihood maximum posteriori estimates  true scene sensor images. Maximum likelihood estimates  parameters image formation model involve (local)  order image statistics, related local principal  component analysis. demonstrate efficacy method  images visible-band infrared sensors.
