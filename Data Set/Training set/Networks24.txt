 Network Address Translation (NAT) January 1993, Tony Eng published paper propose Network Address Translation (NAT) CCR based previous summer Tony's internship Bellcore. Early 1994, according Wikipedia, development started PIX (Private Internet Exchange) firewall product John Mayes, included NAT key feature. 1994 RFC NAT published (RFC 1631). PIX huge success, bought Cisco November 1995. asked Sigcomm Industrial Liaison Board write series articles theme “Examples Research Affecting Practice Networking.” goal series help find ways research community increase industrial impact. argued board NAT isn't don't think lessons learned apply today's environment. start contemporary Openflow. isn’t NAT example? It's researcher success NAT, reasons success NAT reason developed NAT place. explain. conceived NAT solution expected depletion IPv4 address space. bought PIX, however, wanted help slow global consumption IP addresses. bought PIX firewalls needed connect private networks public Internet. time, common practice assign random unregistered IP address private networking equipment hosts. Picking random address easier than, instance, going regional internet registry obtain addresses, especially intent connect private network public Internet. obviously problem unregistered private addresses wished connect Internet. PIX firewall saved trouble trying obtain adequate block IP addresses, renumber networks order connect Internet unregistered addresses. Indeed, PIX conceived John Mayes IP variant telephone PBX (Private Branch Exchange), private phone systems operate private numbers, needing single public phone number. NAT episode, seen point view time, boils this. published NAT CCR (thanks Dave Oran, editor allowed it). me, end it. later, contacted Kjeld Egevang Cray Communications, wanted write RFC NAT legitimize implementation NAT. helped lent RFC. (In days, needed publish RFC approval guy, Jon Postel!) thing knew, NAT everywhere. problem trying solve, problem PIX solved, different, fact reason think John Mayes Kjeld Egevang idea NAT CCR paper. lesson learned researchers today be? This: Solve interesting problem business model, publish paper it, hope idea solve problem business model. Clearly interesting lesson. agree motivation article series. hard industrial impact networking today. tried ago effort turn ViAggre (NSDI’09) RFC. Months effort yielded nothing, rightly so. hope others, especially positive recent results, contribute series.
