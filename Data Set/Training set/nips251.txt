  paper presents fast k-NN classifier based  binary CMM (Correlation Matrix Memory) neural network. robust  encoding method developed meet CMM input requirements.  hardware implementation CMM described, 200  times speed current mid-range workstation, scaleable  large problems. tested benchmarks compared  simple k-NN method, CMM classifier gave 1% lower  /tccuracy 12 times speed-up software hardware  respectively.
