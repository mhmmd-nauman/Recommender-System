 Spatiotemporal Traffic Matrix Synthesis Traffic matrices describe volume traffic set sources destinations network. matrices variety tasks network planning traffic engineering, design network topologies. Traffic matrices naturally possess complex spatiotemporal characteristics, proprietary nature means data publicly, situation unlikely change. goal develop techniques synthesize traffic matrices researchers wish test network applications protocols. paucity data, desire build general framework synthesis settings requires look problem. show principle maximum entropy generate wide variety traffic matrices constrained needs task, information, avoiding hidden assumptions data. demonstrate framework encompasses existing models measurements, apply simple case study illustrate value.
