Traditional motion planning algo-  rithms assume mobile robot track position reliably, however, real  situations, reliable localization feasible. Partially Observable  Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide maximize certainty  reaching goal state, cost computational intractability large  spaces.  method propose explicitly models uncertainty robot's position  variable, generates trajectories augmented pose-uncertainty  space. minimizing positional uncertainty goal, robot reduces  likelihood lost. demonstrate experimentally coastal navigation  reduces uncertainty goal, especially degraded localization.
