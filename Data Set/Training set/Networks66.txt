 PGA: Graphs Express Automatically Reconcile Network Policies Software Defined Networking (SDN) cloud automation enable large number diverse parties (network operators, application admins, tenants/end-users) control programs (SDN Apps, network services) generate network policies independently dynamically. existing policy abstractions frameworks support natural expression automatic composition high-level policies diverse sources. tackle open problem automatic, correct fast composition multiple independently network policies. develop high-level Policy Graph Abstraction (PGA) network policies expressed simply independently, leverage graph structure detect resolve policy conflicts efficiently. supporting ACL policies, PGA models composes service chaining policies, i.e., sequence middleboxes traversed, merging multiple service chain requirements conflict-free composed chains. system validation large enterprise network policy dataset demonstrates practical composition times large inputs, sub-millisecond runtime latencies.
