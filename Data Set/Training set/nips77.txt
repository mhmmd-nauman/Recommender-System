 Local linear regression performs low-dimensional  forecasting problems. high-dimensional spaces, performance  typically decays due well-known "curse-of-dimensionality".  approach problem varying "shape"  weighting kernel. suggest new, data-driven  method estimating optimal kernel shape. Experiments artificially generated data set data UC Irvine  repository show benefits kernel shaping.
