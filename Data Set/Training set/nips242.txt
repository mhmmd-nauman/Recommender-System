  paper present approach multichannel blind  separation/generalized deconvolution, assuming mixing  demixing models stable linear state-space sys-  tems. decompose blind separation problem pro-  cess: separation estimation. Based minimization  Kullback-Leibler Divergence, develop learning algo-  rithm train matrices output equation. estimate  demixing model, introduce concept, called  hidden innovation, numerically implement Kalman filter.  Computer simulations show validity high ef-  fectiveness state-space approach.
