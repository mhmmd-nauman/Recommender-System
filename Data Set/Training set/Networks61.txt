 Rollback-Recovery Middleboxes Network middleboxes offer high availability, automatic failover device fails. Achieving high availability challenging failover correctly restore lost (e.g., activity logs, port mappings) quickly (e.g., typical transport timeout values minimize disruption applications) overhead failure-free operation (e.g., additional per-packet latencies 10-100s us). existing middlebox design failover correct, fast recover, imposes increased latency failure-free operations. present design fault-tolerance middleboxes achieves goals. system, FTMB (for Fault-Tolerant MiddleBox), adopts classical approach "rollback recovery" system information logged normal operation correctly reconstruct failure. However, traditional rollback recovery maintain high throughput frequent output rate middleboxes. Hence, design solution record middlebox relies mechanisms: (1) 'ordered logging', lightweight logging information needed recovery, (2) 'parallel release' algorithm which, coupled ordered logging, ensures recovery correct. implement ordered logging parallel release Click show test applications design adds 30us latency median packet latencies. system introduces moderate throughput overheads (5-30%) reconstruct lost 40-275ms practical systems.
