  Lazy learning memory-based technique that, query re-  ceived, extracts prediction interpolating locally neighboring exam-  ples query considered relevant according distance  measure. paper propose data-driven method select  query-by-query basis optimal number neighbors considered  prediction. efficient identify validate local  models, recursive squares algorithm introduced con-  text local approximation lazy learning. Furthermore,  winner-takes-all strategy model selection, local combination  promising models explored. method proposed tested  datasets compared state-of-the-art approach.
