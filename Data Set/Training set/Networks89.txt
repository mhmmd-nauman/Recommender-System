 Design Implementation: Native Web Browser Server Content-Centric Networking Content-Centric Networking (CCN) recently emerged clean-slate Future Internet architecture completely communication pattern compared exiting IP network. Wide Web popular important applications Internet, effectively support dominant browser server based web applications key success CCN. However, existing web browsers servers mainly designed HTTP protocol TCP/IP networks directly support CCN-based web applications. Existing research mainly focuses plug-in proxy/gateway approaches client server sides, schemes seriously impact service performance due multiple protocol conversions. address problems, designed implemented CCN web browser CCN web server natively support CCN protocol. facilitate smooth evolution IP networks CCN, CCNBrowser CCNxTomcat support HTTP protocol CCN. Experimental results show CCNBrowser CCNxTomcat outperform existing implementations. Finally, real CCN-based web application deployed CCN experimental testbed, validates applicability CCNBrowser CCNxTomcat.
