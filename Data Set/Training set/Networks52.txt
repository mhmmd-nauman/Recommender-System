 R2C2: Network Stack Rack-scale Computers Rack-scale computers, comprising large number microservers connected direct-connect topology, expected replace servers building block data centers. focus problem routing congestion control rack's network, find high path diversity rack topologies, combination workload diversity it, means traditional solutions inadequate. introduce R2C2, network stack rack-scale computers flexible efficient routing congestion control. R2C2 leverages fact scale rack topologies low-overhead broadcasting ensure nodes rack aware network flows. achieve rate-based congestion control probing; node independently determines sending rate flows respecting provider's allocation policies. routing, nodes dynamically choose routing protocol flow order maximize utility. prototype deployed rack emulation platform packet-level simulator, show R2C2 achieves low queuing high throughput diverse bursty workloads, routing flexibility provide significant throughput gains.
