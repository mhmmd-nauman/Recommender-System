 consider problem learning grid-based map robot  noisy sensors actuators. compare approaches:  online EM, map treated fixed parameter,  Bayesian inference, map (matrix-valued) random  variable. show simple example, online EM  stuck local minima, robot "lost"  resulting map useless. contrast, Bayesian  approach, maintaining multiple hypotheses, ro-  bust. introduce method approximating Bayesian  solution, called Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering. show  approximation, coupled active learning strategy,  fast accurate.
