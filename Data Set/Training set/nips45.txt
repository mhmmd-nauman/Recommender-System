 study simple stochastic single neuron model delayed  self-feedback capable generating spike trains. Simulations show  spike trains exhibit resonant behavior "noise"  "delay". order gain insight resonance, simplify  model study stochastic binary element transition  probability depends fixed interval past.  simplified model analytically compute interspike  interval histograms, show resonance noise  delay arises. resonance observed elements  coupled delayed interaction.
