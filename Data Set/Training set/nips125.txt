 Facial Action Coding System (FACS) (9) objective  method quantifying facial movement terms component  actions. system widely behavioral investigations  emotion, cognitive processes, social interaction. cod-  ing presently performed highly trained human experts.  paper explores compares techniques automatically recog-  nizing facial actions sequences images. methods include  unsupervised learning techniques finding basis images  principal component analysis, independent component analysis  local feature analysis, supervised learning techniques  Fisher's linear discriminants. data-driven bases com-  pared Gabor wavelets, basis images predefined.  performances obtained Gabor wavelet repre-  sentation independent component representation,  achieved 96% accuracy classifying 12 facial actions.  ICA representation employs orders magnitude fewer basis im-  ages Gabor representation takes 90% CPU  compute images. results provide converging support  local basis images, high spatial frequencies, statistical  independence classifying facial actions.
