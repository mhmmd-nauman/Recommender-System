 BlindBox: Deep Packet Inspection Encrypted Traffic network middleboxes perform deep packet inspection (DPI), set tasks examine packet payloads. tasks include intrusion detection (IDS), exfiltration detection, parental filtering. However, long-standing issue packets HTTPS, middleboxes longer accomplish tasks payloads encrypted. Hence, faced choice desirable properties: functionality middleboxes privacy encryption. propose BlindBox, system simultaneously properties. approach BlindBox perform deep-packet inspection directly encrypted traffic. BlindBox realizes approach protocol encryption schemes. demonstrate BlindBox enables applications IDS, exfiltration detection parental filtering, supports real rulesets open-source industrial DPI systems. implemented BlindBox showed practical settings long-lived HTTPS connections. Moreover, core encryption scheme 3-6 orders magnitude faster existing relevant cryptographic schemes.
