 nonnegative Boltzmann machine (NNBM) recurrent neural net-  model describe multimodal nonnegative data. Application  maximum likelihood estimation model learning rule  analogous binary Boltzmann machine. examine utility  mean field approximation NNBM, describe Monte  Carlo sampling techniques learn parameters. Reflec-  tive slice sampling well-suited distribution,  efficiently implemented sample distribution. illustrate  learning NNBM translationally invariant distribution,  generative model images human faces.
