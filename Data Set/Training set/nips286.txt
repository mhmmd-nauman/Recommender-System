  simple learning rule derived, VAPS algorithm,  instantiated generate wide range reinforcement-  learning algorithms. algorithms solve number open  problems, define approaches reinforcement learning,  unify approaches reinforcement learning  single theory. algorithms guaranteed convergence,  include modifications existing algorithms  known fail converge simple MDPs. include Q-  learning, SARSA, advantage learning. addition  value-based algorithms generates pure policy-search  reinforcement-learning algorithms, learn optimal policies  learning function. addition, policy-  search value-based algorithms combined, unifying  approaches reinforcement learning  single Policy Search (VAPS) algorithm.  algorithms converge POMDPs requiring proper belief  state. Simulations results given, areas future  research discussed.
