  Human animal studies show mammalian brain undergoes  massive synaptic pruning childhood, removing half  synapses puberty. previously shown main-  taining network memory performance synapses deleted,  requires synapses properly modified pruned, remov-  ing weaker synapses. show neuronal regulation,  mechanism recently observed maintain average neuronal in-  put field, results weight-dependent synaptic modification.  correct range degradation dimension synaptic up-  bound, neuronal regulation removes weaker synapses  judiciously modifies remaining synapses. implements  optimal synaptic modification, maintains memory perfor-  mance network undergoing massive synaptic pruning. Thus,  paper shows addition known effects Hebbian  changes, neuronal regulation play important role  self-organization brain networks development.
