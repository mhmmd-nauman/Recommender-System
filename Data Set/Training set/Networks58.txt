 Adaptive Congestion Control Unpredictable Cellular Networks Legacy congestion controls including TCP variants known perform poorly cellular networks due highly variable capacities short scales, self-inflicted packet delays, packet losses unrelated congestion. cope challenges, present Verus, end-to-end congestion control protocol delay measurements react quickly capacity cellular networks explicitly attempting predict cellular channel dynamics. key idea Verus continuously learn delay profile captures relationship end-to-end packet delay outstanding window size short epochs relationship increment decrement window size based observed short-term packet delay variations. delay-based control primarily congestion avoidance, Verus standard TCP features including multiplicative decrease packet loss slow start. combination simulations, empirical evaluations cellular network traces, real-world evaluations standard TCP flavors art protocols Sprout, show Verus outperforms protocols cellular channels. comparison TCP Cubic, Verus achieves order magnitude (> 10x) reduction delay 3G LTE networks achieving comparable throughput (sometimes marginally higher). comparison Sprout, Verus achieves 30% higher throughput rapidly changing cellular networks.
