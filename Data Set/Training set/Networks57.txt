 Central Control Distributed Routing Centralizing routing decisions offers tremendous flexibility, sacrifices robustness distributed protocols. paper, present Fibbing, architecture achieves flexibility robustness central control distributed routing. Fibbing introduces fake nodes links underlying linkstate routing protocol, routers compute forwarding tables based augmented topology. Fibbing expressive, readily supports flexible load balancing, traffic engineering, backup routes. Based high-level forwarding requirements, Fibbing controller computes compact augmented topology injects fake components standard routing-protocol messages. Fibbing works unmodified routers speaking OSPF. experiments show scale large networks forwarding requirements, introduces minimal overhead, quickly reacts network controller failures.
