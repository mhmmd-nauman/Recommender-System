  solve dynamics Hopfield-type neural networks store se-  quences patterns, close saturation. asymmetry interaction  matrix models leads violation detailed balance, ruling  equilibrium statistical mechanical analysis. generating functional  methods derive exact closed equations dynamical order parame-  ters, viz. sequence overlap correlation response functions,  limit infinite system size. calculate translation  invariant solutions equations, describing stationary limit-cycles,  leads phase diagram. effective retarded self-interaction  appearing symmetric models found vanish,  significantly enlarged storage capacity acm 0.269, com-  pared acm 0.139 Hopfield networks s[oring static patterns.  results tested extensive computer simulations excellent  agreement found.
