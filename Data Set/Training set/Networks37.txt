 Laissez-Faire: Fully Asymmetric Backscatter Communication Backscatter dual-benefits energy harvesting low-power communication, making attractive broad class wireless sensors. design protocol enables extremely power-efficient radios harvesting-based sensors high-rate data transfer data-rich sensors presents conundrum. paper, present fully asymmetric backscatter communication protocol nodes blindly transmit data sense. model enables fully flexible node designs, extraordinarily powerefficient backscatter radios consume barely micro-watts high-throughput radios stream hundreds Kbps consuming paltry tens micro-watts. challenge, however, lies decoding concurrent streams reader, achieve combination time-domain separation interleaved signal edges, phase-domain separation colliding transmissions. provide implementation protocol, LF-Backscatter, show achieve order magnitude improvement throughput, latency power state-of-art alternatives.
