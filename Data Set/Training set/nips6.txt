 figure-ground segregation network proposed based  boundary pair representation. Nodes network bound-  ary segments obtained local grouping. node ex-  citatorily coupled neighboring nodes belong  region, inhibitorily coupled paired  node. Gestalt grouping rules incorporated modulating con-  nections. status node represents probability  figural updated according differential equation.  system solves figure-ground segregation problem tem-  poral evolution. perceptual phenomena, modal  amodal completion, virtual contours, grouping shape de-  composition explained local diffusion. system  eliminates combinatorial optimization accounts psy-  chophysical results fixed set parameters.
