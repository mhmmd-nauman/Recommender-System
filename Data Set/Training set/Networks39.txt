 Silo: Predictable Message Latency Cloud cloud applications benefit guaranteed latency network messages, providing predictability hard, especially multi-tenant datacenters. identify key requirements predictability: guaranteed network bandwidth, guaranteed packet delay guaranteed burst allowance. present Silo, system offers guarantees multi-tenant datacenters. Silo leverages tight coupling bandwidth delay: controlling tenant bandwidth leads deterministic bounds network queuing delay. Silo builds network calculus place tenant VMs competing requirements coexist. hypervisor-based policing mechanism achieves packet pacing sub-microsecond granularity, ensuring tenants exceed allowances. implemented Silo prototype comprising VM placement manager Windows filter driver. Silo require applications, guest OSes network switches. show Silo ensure predictable message latency cloud applications imposing low overhead.
