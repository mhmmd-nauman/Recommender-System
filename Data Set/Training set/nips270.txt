  paper presents probabilistic modeling methods solve problem dis-  criminating facial orientations labeled data.  models explored. model maintains inter-pixel dependencies,  model capable modeling set arbitrary pair-wise dependencies,  model dependencies neighboring pixels.  show models, accuracy learned models  greatly improved augmenting small number labeled training images  large set unlabeled images Expectation-Maximization.  important difficult obtain image labels, unla-  beled images readily available. large set empirical tests,  examine benefits unlabeled data models.  randomly selected labeled examples class, discriminate  facial orientations accuracy 94%; labeled examples,  achieve accuracy 98%.
