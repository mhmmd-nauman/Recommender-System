 Dual estimation refers problem simultaneously estimating  dynamic system model rise dynam-  ics. Algorithms include expectation-maximization (EM), dual Kalman  filtering, joint Kalman methods. methods recently  explored context nonlinear modeling, neural network  functional form unknown model. Typically, ex-  tended Kalman filter (EKF) smoother part al-  gorithm estimates clean current estimated model.  EKF estimate weights network.  paper points flaws EKF, proposes improve-  ment based approach called unscented transformation (UT)  [3]. substantial performance gain achieved order  computational complexity standard EKF. approach  illustrated dual estimation methods.
