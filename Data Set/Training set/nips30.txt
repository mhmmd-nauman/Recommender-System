 paper presents practical framework Bayesian model  averaging model selection probabilistic graphical models.  approach approximates full posterior distributions model  parameters structures, latent variables, analyt-  ical manner. posteriors fall free-form optimization  procedure, naturally incorporates conjugate priors. Unlike  large sample approximations, posteriors generally non-  Gaussian Hessian needs computed. Predictive quanti-  ties obtained analytically. resulting algorithm generalizes  standard Expectation Maximization algorithm, conver-  gence guaranteed. demonstrate approach  applied large class models domains, including  mixture models source separation.
