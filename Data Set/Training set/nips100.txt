 Imagine wish classify data consisting tens thousands examples residing twenty thousand dimensional space. apply standard machine learning algorithms? describe Parallel Problems Server (PPServer) MATLAB*P. tandem allow users  networked computers transparently large data sets  Matlab. motivated desire bring benefits  scientific computing algorithms computational power machine  learning researchers.  demonstrate usefulness system number tasks.  example, perform independent components analysis large text  corpora consisting tens thousands documents, making minimal  original Bell Sejnowski Matlab source (Bell Sejnowski, 1995). Applying ML techniques data previously  reach leads interesting analyses data algorithms.
