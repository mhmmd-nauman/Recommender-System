 Evaluation Tail Loss Recovery Mechanisms TCP Interactive applications require bandwidth faster. Instead, require latency. Unfortunately, current design transport protocols TCP limits latency reductions. paper evaluate compare di?erent loss recovery enhancements ?ght tail loss latency. recently proposed mechanisms "RTO Restart" (RTOR) "Tail Loss Probe" (TLP) mechanism applies logic RTOR TLP timer management (TLPR) considered. results show relative performance RTOR TLP tail loss occurs scenario dependent, TLP potentially larger gains. TLPR mechanism reaps bene?ts approaches scenarios shows performance.
