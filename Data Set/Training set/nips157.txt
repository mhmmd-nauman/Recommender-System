  Historically, connectionist systems excelled represent-  ing manipulating complex structures. system com-  posed simple neuron-like computing elements encode complex  relations? Recently, researchers begun appreciate rep-  resentations extend space. researchers  proposed synchronous firing units encode com-  plex representations. identify limitations approach  present asynchronous model binding effectively rep-  resents complex structures. asynchronous model extends  synchronous approach. argue cognitive architecture uti-  lizes similar mechanism.
