  recent neural model illusory contour formation based  distribution natural shapes traced particles moving  constant speed directions Brownian motions. input  model consists pairs position direction constraints  output consists distribution contours joining  pairs. general, contours closed  distribution scale-invariant. paper, show  compute scale-invariant distribution closed contours  position constraints result explain  known illusory contour effect.
