 Congestion Control Large-Scale RDMA Deployments Modern datacenter applications demand high throughput (40Gbps) ultra-low latency (< 10 hop) network, low CPU overhead. Standard TCP/IP stacks meet requirements, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) can. IP-routed datacenter networks, RDMA deployed RoCEv2 protocol, relies Priority-based Flow Control (PFC) enable drop-free network. However, PFC lead poor application performance due problems head-of-line blocking unfairness. alleviates problems, introduce DCQCN, end-to-end congestion control scheme RoCEv2. optimize DCQCN performance, build fluid model, provide guidelines tuning switch buffer thresholds, protocol parameters. 3-tier Clos network testbed, show DCQCN dramatically improves throughput fairness RoCEv2 RDMA traffic. DCQCN implemented Mellanox NICs, deployed Microsoft's datacenters.
