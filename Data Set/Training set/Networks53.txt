 Enabling End-Host Network Functions network functions executed modern datacenters, e.g., load balancing, application-level QoS, congestion control, exhibit common properties data plane: need access modify state, perform computations, access application semantics -- critical network functions expressed terms application-level messages. paper, argue end hosts natural enforcement point functions present Eden, architecture implementing network functions end hosts minimal network support. Eden comprises components, centralized controller, enclave end host, Eden-compliant applications called stages. implement network functions, controller configures stages classify data messages enclaves apply action functions based packet's class. Eden prototype includes enclaves implemented OS kernel programmable NICs. case studies, show application-level classification ability run actual programs data-path Eden efficiently support broad range network functions network's edge.
