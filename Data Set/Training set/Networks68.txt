 Jupiter Rising: Decade Clos Topologies Centralized Control Google's Datacenter Network present approach overcoming cost, operational complexity, limited scale endemic datacenter networks decade ago. themes unify generations datacenter networks detailed paper. First, multi-stage Clos topologies built commodity switch silicon support cost-effective deployment building-scale networks. Second, general, complex, decentralized network routing management protocols supporting arbitrary deployment scenarios overkill single-operator, pre-planned datacenter networks. built centralized control mechanism based global configuration pushed datacenter switches. Third, modular hardware design coupled simple, robust software allowed design support inter-cluster wide-area networks. datacenter networks run dozens sites planet, scaling capacity 100x ten 1Pbps bisection bandwidth.
