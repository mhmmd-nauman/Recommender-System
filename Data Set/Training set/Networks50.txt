 BackFi: High Throughput WiFi Backscatter present BackFi, communication system enables high throughput, range communication low power backscatter IoT sensors WiFi APs ambient WiFi transmissions excitation signal. Specifically, show design IoT sensors WiFi APs WiFi AP process transmitting data normal WiFi clients decode backscatter signals IoT sensors generate modulating information ambient WiFi transmission. show prototypes experiments achieve communication rates Mbps range Mbps range meters. performance order orders magnitude known prior WiFi backscatter system [27, 25]. BackFi design energy efficient, relies backscattering needs insignificant power, energy consumed bit small.
