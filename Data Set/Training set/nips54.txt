 paper, propose full Bayesian model neural networks.  model treats model dimension (number neurons), model  parameters, regularisation parameters noise parameters ran-  dom variables need estimated. propose re-  versible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method per-  form computations. find results  previously reported ones,  robust respect prior specification. Moreover,  present geometric convergence theorem algorithm.
