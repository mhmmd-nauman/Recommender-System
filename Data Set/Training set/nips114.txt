 paper, mutual information characterize dis-  tributions phonetic speaker/channel information time-  frequency space. mutual information (MI) pho-  netic label feature, joint mutual information (JMI)  phonetic label features estimated.  Miller's bias formulas entropy mutual information es-  timates extended include higher order terms. MI  JMI speaker/channel recognition estimated.  results complementary phonetic classification.  results show phonetic information locally spread  speaker/channel information globally spread  frequency.
