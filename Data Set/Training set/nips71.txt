 describe incremental algorithm training linear thresh-  functions: Relaxed Online Maximum Margin Algorithm,  ROMMA. ROMMA viewed approximation algorithm  repeatedly chooses hyperplane classifies previously seen ex-  amples correctly maximum margin. known  maximum-margin hypothesis computed minimizing length  weight vector subject number linear constraints. ROMMA  works maintaining simple relaxation constraints  efficiently updated. prove mistake bound ROMMA  proved perceptron algorithm. analysis  implies computationally intensive maximum-margin algo-  rithm satisfies mistake bound; worst-case perfor-  mance guarantee algorithm. describe experiments us-  ing ROMMA variant updates hypothesis aggressively  batch algorithms recognize handwritten digits. computational  complexity simplicity algorithms similar per-  ceptron algorithm, generalization better. describe  sense performance ROMMA converges SVM  limit bias isn't considered.
