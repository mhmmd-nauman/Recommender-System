 Presto: Edge-based Load Balancing Fast Datacenter Networks Datacenter networks deal variety workloads, ranging latency-sensitive small flows bandwidth-hungry large flows. Load balancing schemes based flow hashing, e.g., ECMP, congestion hash collisions occur perform poorly asymmetric topologies. Recent proposals load balance network require centralized traffic engineering, multipath-aware transport, expensive specialized hardware. propose mechanism avoids limitations (i) pushing load-balancing functionality soft network edge (e.g., virtual switches) required transport layer, customer VMs, networking hardware, (ii) load balancing fine-grained, near-uniform units data (flowcells) fit end-host segment offload optimizations support fast networking speeds. design implement soft-edge load balancing scheme, called Presto, evaluate 10 Gbps physical testbed. demonstrate computational impact packet reordering receivers propose mechanism handle reordering TCP receive offload functionality. Presto's performance closely tracks single, non-blocking switch workloads adaptive failures topology asymmetry.
