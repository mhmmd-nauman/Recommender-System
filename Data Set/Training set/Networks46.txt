 Control-Theoretic Approach Dynamic Adaptive Video Streaming HTTP User-perceived quality-of-experience (QoE) critical Internet video applications impacts revenues content providers delivery systems. support network optimizing measures, bottlenecks occur delivery system. Consequently, robust bitrate adaptation algorithm client-side players critical ensure user experience. Previous studies shown key limitations state-of-art commercial solutions proposed range heuristic fixes. Despite emergence proposals, distinct lack consensus on: (1) design client-side bitrate adaptation logic (e.g., rate estimates vs. buffer occupancy); (2) specific classes approaches perform diverse operating regimes (e.g., high throughput variability); (3) actually balance QoE objectives (e.g., startup delay vs. rebuffering). end, paper makes key technical contributions. First, bring rigor space, develop principled control-theoretic model reason broad spectrum strategies. Second, propose model predictive control algorithm optimally combine throughput buffer occupancy information outperform traditional approaches. Third, present practical implementation reference video player validate approach realistic trace-driven emulations.
