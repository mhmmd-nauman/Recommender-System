 paper describes bidirectional recurrent mixture density networks, model multi-modal distributions type  P(xtly T) P(xtlxl,x2,...,xt_,y T) explicit assumptions context. expressions occur frequently pattern recognition problems sequential data,  speech recognition. Experiments show proposed generative models give higher likelihood test data compared traditional modeling approach, indicating  summarize statistical properties data better.
