 Low Latency Geo-distributed Data Analytics Low latency analytics geographically distributed datasets (across datacenters, edge clusters) upcoming increasingly important challenge. dominant approach aggregating data single datacenter significantly inflates timeliness analytics. time, running queries geo-distributed inputs current intra-DC analytics frameworks leads high query response times frameworks cope low variable capacity WAN links. present Iridium, system low latency geo-distributed analytics. Iridium achieves low query response times optimizing placement data tasks queries. joint data task placement optimization, however, intractable. Therefore, Iridium online heuristic redistribute datasets sites prior queries' arrivals, places tasks reduce network bottlenecks query's execution. Finally, knob budget WAN usage. Evaluation worldwide EC2 regions production queries show Iridium speeds queries 3x - 19x lowers WAN usage 15% - 64% compared existing baselines.
