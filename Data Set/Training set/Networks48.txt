 Network-Aware Scheduling Data-Parallel Jobs: Plan reduce impact network congestion big data jobs, cluster management frameworks heuristics schedule compute tasks and/or network flows. schedulers consider job input data fixed greedily schedule tasks flows ready run. However, large fraction production jobs recurring predictable characteristics, plan ahead them. Coordinating placement data tasks jobs significantly improving network locality freeing bandwidth, jobs running cluster. intuition, develop Corral, scheduling framework characteristics future workloads determine offline schedule (i) jointly places data compute achieve data locality, (ii) isolates jobs spatially (by scheduling parts cluster) temporally, improving performance. implement Corral Apache Yarn, evaluate 210 machine cluster production workloads. Compared Yarn's capacity scheduler, Corral reduces makespan workloads 33% median completion 56%, 20-90% reduction data transferred racks.
