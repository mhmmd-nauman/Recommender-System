 present Monte Carlo algorithm learning act partially observable  Markov decision processes (POMDPs) real-valued action spaces.  approach importance sampling representing beliefs, Monte Carlo  approximation belief propagation. reinforcement learning algorithm,  iteration, employed learn functions belief states. Finally, sample-  based version nearest neighbor generalize states. Initial  empirical results suggest approach works practical applications.
