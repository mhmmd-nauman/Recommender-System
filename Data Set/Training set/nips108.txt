 paper examines role biological constraints human audi-  tory localization process. psychophysical neural system modeling  approach undertaken performance comparisons  competing models human subject explore relevant biologi-  cally plausible "realism constraints". directional acoustical cues,  sound localization based, derived human  subject's head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). Sound stimuli  generated convolving bandpass noise HRTFs pre-  sented subject model. input stimuli model  processed Auditory Image Model cochlear processing.  cochlear data analyzed time-delay neural network  integrated temporal spectral information determine spa-  tial location sound source. combined cochlear model  neural network provided system model sound localization pro-  cess. Human-like localization performance qualitatively achieved  broadband bandpass stimuli model architecture incor-  porated frequency division (or tonotopicity), trained vari-  able bandwidth center-frequency sounds.
