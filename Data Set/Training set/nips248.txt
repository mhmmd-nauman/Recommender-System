  describe single microphone sound localization system  inspiration theories human monaural sound localiza-  tion. Reflections diffractions caused external ear (pinna)  allow humans estimate sound source elevations  ear. single microphone localization model relies specially  shaped reflecting structure serves role pinna. Spe-  cially designed analog VLSI circuitry echo-time processing  localize sound. CMOS integrated circuit designed,  fabricated, successfully demonstrated actual sounds.
