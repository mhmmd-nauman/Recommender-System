 Large-scale Measurements Wireless Network Behavior Meraki cloud-based network management system centralized configuration, monitoring, network troubleshooting tools hundreds thousands sites worldwide. part architecture, Meraki system built database time-series measurements wireless link, client, application behavior monitoring debugging purposes. paper studies anonymized subset measurements, data approximately ten thousand radio access points, tens thousands links, 5.6 million clients one-week periods January 2014 January 2015 provide deeper understanding realworld network behavior. paper observes phenomena: wireless network usage continues grow quickly, driven growth number devices connecting network. Intermediate link delivery rates common indoors wide range deployment environments. Typical access points share spectrum dozens nearby networks, presence network channel predict channel utilization. access points 2.4 GHz channel utilization 20% more, top decile seeing greater 50%, majority channel decodable 802.11 headers.
