 Federated End-to-End Authentication Constrained Internet Things IBC ECC Authentication smart objects major challenge Internet Things (IoT), left open DTLS. Leveraging locally managed IPv6 addresses identitybased cryptography (IBC), propose efficient end-to-end authentication (a) assigns robust deploymentfriendly federation scheme gateways IoT subnetworks, (b) evaluated modern twisted Edwards elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). early results demonstrate feasibility promise efficiency ongoing optimisations.
