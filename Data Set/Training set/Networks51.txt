 Herd: Scalable, Traffic Analysis Resistant Anonymity Network VoIP Systems Effectively anonymizing Voice-over-IP (VoIP) calls requires scalable anonymity network resilient traffic analysis sufficiently low delay high-quality voice calls. popular Tor anonymity network, instance, designed typically achieve latter. paper, present design, implementation, experimental evaluation Herd, anonymity network set dedicated, fully interconnected cloud-based proxies yield suitably low-delay circuits, untrusted superpeers add scalability. Herd caller/callee anonymity clients trust zone (e.g., jurisdiction) strong adversarial model. Simulations based trace 370 million mobile phone calls 10.8 million users Herd achieves anonymity millions clients low bandwidth requirements, superpeers decrease bandwidth CPU requirements trusted infrastructure order magnitude. Finally, experiments prototype deployment Amazon EC2 show Herd delay low high-quality calls cases.
