 Enabling Performance Evaluation 10 Gbps Despite network monitoring testing critical computer networks, current solutions extremely expensive inflexible. demo presents OSNT (www.osnt.org), communitydriven, high-performance, open-source traffic generator capture system built top NetFPGA-10G board enables flexible network testing. platform supports full line-rate traffic generation regardless packet size card ports, packet capture filtering packet thinning hardware sub-usec precision traffic generation capture, corrected external GPS device. Furthermore, software APIs test dataplane performance multi-10G switches, providing starting point number test cases. OSNT flexibility demonstrated OFLOPS-turbo platform: integration OSNT OFLOPS OpenFlow switch performance evaluation platform, enabling control data plane evaluation 10G switches. demo showcases applicability OSNT platform evaluate performance legacy OpenFlowenabled networking devices, demonstrates commercial switches.
