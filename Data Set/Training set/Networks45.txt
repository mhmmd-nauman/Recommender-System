 Encore: Lightweight Measurement Web Censorship Cross-Origin Requests Despite pervasiveness Internet censorship, scant data extent, mechanisms, evolution. Measuring censorship challenging: requires continual measurement reachability target sites diverse vantage points. Amassing suitable vantage points longitudinal measurement difficult; existing systems achieved small, short-lived deployments. observe, however, Internet users access content Web browsers, nature Web site design browsers requests domains origins main Web page. present Encore, system harnesses crossorigin requests measure Web filtering diverse set vantage points requiring users install custom software, enabling longitudinal measurements vantage points. explain Encore induces Web clients perform cross-origin requests measure Web filtering, design distributed platform scheduling collecting measurements, show feasibility global-scale deployment pilot study analysis potentially censored Web content, identify cases filtering months measurements, discuss ethical concerns arise widespread deployment.
