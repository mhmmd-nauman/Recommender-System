 give sufficient conditions uniqueness  support vector solution problems pattern recognition  regression estimation, general class cost functions. show  solution unique, support vectors necessarily  bound, give simple examples non-unique solu-  tions. note uniqueness primal (dual) solution  necessarily imply uniqueness dual (primal) solution.  show compute threshold solution unique,  support vectors bound, case usual  method determining work.
